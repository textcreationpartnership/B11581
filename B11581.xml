            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:176914:3"/> God, and the tender bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion which I haue credibly heard, and partly seene in your Ladishippe, hath often times stirred me vp, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to adde some good thing vnto the heape of those your good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertues. But finding nothing in my selfe wherewith to answere my desire, worthie the learning, what by reason of the want of knowledge and wisdome in me: I in the end resolued with my selfe to giue ouer my purpose and determination, and to finish with prayer vnto God, That it would please his Maiestie to blesse his giftes in you with encrease, so farre forth as it shall be thought good to his heauenly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to appoint: neuerthelesse, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding some time as my leysure woulde serue me in reading ouer diuerse and sundry expositions of the sacred scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I lighted vppon this short para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase of DANIELL TOVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAINE of the holy Lamentations of the Prophet Ieremiah, an apt and fitte peece of worke (in my poore opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) to be euery way applyed vnto these our dayes, aswel for the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all the faithfull childrē of God that are vnder the crosse &amp; feele their

And because (as I haue alreadie sayde) I finde nothing in my selfe to further that loue of vertue and zeale of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie which GOD in great mercy hath vouchsafed vpon you, I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned at the handes of this godly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and preacher of the word, DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIELL TOVSSAINE, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my want, whom, if it shall please your Ladiship attentiuely with good affection to heare: the paine no doubt shall be much lesse than the profite, and you therby shall not faile to reape great fruite. The point of which small trauaile shall soone take ende, and the gaine long remaine and continue. And therefore whatsoeuer here shalbe handled in this little treatise: I most humbly beseech your good Ladiship alwayes in some measure to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. To be short, If the people of the Iewes in Ierusalem hadde made an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the wordes of the Prophet in forewarning them of their destruction:
<pb facs="tcp:176914:4"/> if they turned not vnto their God, it had not so fallen out with them as it did. But because they beleeued him not, but dealt most cruelly with him, the Lorde in his iust iudgementes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited their obstinacie. For, the verie name of God his word, ought to strike into our heartes great reuerence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes it, great desire to haue it, great haste to heare it, great loue to read it, and like care to keepe it. If a King or Queene should write vnto vs, Oh, how readie would we be to shore vppe our eares? What haste would we make to heare the contents of the same? But beholde, God him selfe hath directed his letters to euerie one of vs, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie of which, is his owne holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and his Prophets, Apostles, and Ministers are his purseuauntes and messengers, which bring them vnto vs. And therefore, intollerable is our cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt towardes his Maiestie, that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, if we do not humbly heare and reade them, and diligently marke and obserue the especiall pointes and contents of them. And as it is written: the very dreadfull wordes of God doe follow such contempt.</p>

Some there are that make much a do in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth and aduauncing those authours, vpon whose workes they intende to coment, as <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> writing vpon <hi>Paule</hi> his
<pb facs="tcp:176914:5"/> Epistles, hath done. Howbeit, it is a thing of all others, least necessarie, namely when the Authors are sufficiently knowen, &amp; of such note and marke, as that in too too much cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of them, it is but a darkening of their commendacions, as of the ouer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of the Prophetes, and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. And therefore it shall not be needeful, to make any great narration in the commē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> who was a right faithfull seruaunt of the Lordes, and a valiant preacher of his iust iudgementes, and therefore out of all measure, more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, tossed and tourmoyled, and crossed than any of all the other Prophets euer were, yea euen put to a thousand deathes: who issued and descended from the rest of the stocke of the Priests, that were resiant in <hi>Anathoth,</hi> belonging to the ligne of <hi>Beiamin,</hi> descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from <hi>Abiathar</hi> the high Priest, whom king <hi>Salomon,</hi> as in the <hi>2.</hi> Chap. of the <hi>1.</hi> Booke of the kinges, we reade, had bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed thether.</p>
            <p>It shall suffice therefore at this present, that we aduertise the Readers of foure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie pointes to be obserued, in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these Lamentations of Ieremie.</p>
            <p>First, of the Title, or inscription of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Booke.</p>
            <p>Secondarily, of the occasion, and of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:176914:6"/> argument, or subiect thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, of the Methode, or order which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Prophet keepeth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, of the vse of this Treatise, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> how requisite the consideration thereof is, for the dayes wherein we liue.</p>
            <p>The first point then that in this litle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise must be regarded, which the Hebrewes alwayes accustomed to cut off, and separate from the prophesie of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and place it after the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> among the holie collections (as we call them) that is to say, The Canticle of Canticles, Ruth, Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes, the booke of Hester, and such other like, is this, That the Jewes in the bodie of the Bible, called this commonly by none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name, but by the first worde wherewith the Lamentations beginne, which worde is, ECHA, that is to saye, HOWE, And this worde, according to the iudgement of the Hebrewes, is encountered not without some mysterie, thrice in the beginning of three of the Chapters of these Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to wit, in the beginning of the first, seconde, and fourth: some supposing, that these three encounters of one and the selfe same worde, haue regard vnto the thee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in trinitie: some others taking it as for a perfect number, haue regard to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, whole, and totall desolation of the citie
<pb facs="tcp:176914:6"/> of Jerusalem, and of the countrey round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, when as the Hebrewes make mention of this booke in their commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they call it, CINOTH, that is to say, Lamentations or mournings, proceeding from a lamentable voyce, hauing alwaies an vndoubted regarde to the principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Booke. For, although we finde in this little booke, consolations and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers mixte together, especially in the fifte Chapiter: yet beareth it iustly and of very right, the name of the chiefe argument, and principall matter, and is a verie fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sorrowe and griefe, and a most liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly representation of the ignominie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, which at that time lighted vpon <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and vpon the whole countrey of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The seauentie interpreters vnto whome the Greeke translation is attributed, and the common latine translation also, for the helping of the argument, haue put in these wordes in the beginning thereof: <hi>And it came to passe, that after Israell was ledde captiue, that the Prophet Ieremiah sate weeping, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ouer Ierusalem, with this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, sighing and groning in the bitternesse of his heart; and saying,
<pb facs="tcp:176914:7"/> as followeth. &amp;c.</hi> Howbeit we can finde no such thing written in the Hebrew text.</p>
            <p>As concerning the argument, subiect, and occasion of this shorte Treatise of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, there is no likelihoode, as <hi>Rabe Salomon</hi> and some others thinke, that it should be the same booke, whereof mention is made in the <hi>30.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Ieremie</hi> his prophecie: which when <hi>Ieremie</hi> had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to <hi>Baruch</hi> by worde of mouth, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde, read to the people: and after, that king <hi>Ioachim,</hi> had once gotten it into his handes, he foorthwith cut it in pieces with a penneknife, and threw it into the fire. For there expresse mention is made, that there were no Lamentations conteyned within that Booke, but the threatninges of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudith:</hi> yea euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same demonstrations, which the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> had before, liuely made, which <hi>Baruch</hi> describing, was ouercome with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing and sighing, as in the <hi>45.</hi> chapter of <hi>Ieremie</hi> we may reade.</p>
            <p>Neither must we thinke, that that which is saide in the beginning of the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Lamentations: <hi>I am the man, that hath seene affliction in the rodde of his indignation, and that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,</hi> any whit fauoureth the foresaide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pinion: as though <hi>Ieremie</hi> would frame a
<pb facs="tcp:176914:7"/> complaint only of his particular aduersities, and of the tormentes which the Jewes had vsed against him before the taking of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> For, we knowe well inough, that it is a customarie thing with the Prophets, to represent, and as a man would saye, inuest, and put vpon them the person of the people, aswell, the more to stirre vp the Auditorie, and strike their heartes, as also because it is the nature of Charitie, to appropriate the publike myseries to her selfe, and so take them as if they particularly touched euerie one of vs. Such a great and notable courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and faithfulnes was in the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,</hi> as that although the people of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> had, through their stubbernnesse, and rebellion, heaped vpon themselues such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series in that they had despitefully, &amp; arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly contemned, and trode vnder foote, the holy aduertisementes of this good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: yet would hee not but be partaker of their sorrowe and ruine, as if the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had particularly lyen vpon himselfe. O tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and singular strict and straite line of heartie and tender loue. Such a heartie loue also had that excellent Martyr <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> when writing vpon those, that in the time of persecution had stumbled and slidde, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it downe in these termes, I am partaker of the heauie burden of their griefe: J la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:176914:8"/> with those that lament: I account my selfe among those which are abased and cast downe: A brotherly affection suteth me in the same bunch of my forlorne brethren, &amp;c. And thus much as concerning the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide opinion.</p>
            <p>Howbeit there are some, and that verie great Clerkes and learned personages, which are of the opinion, that these Lamentations of <hi>Ieremie</hi> were written immediately after the death of that good King <hi>Iosias,</hi> and that by reason of the Lamentable discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyture, in the fieldes of Mageddo. Which they grounde vppon two principall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. First vpon that that is recited in the <hi>35.</hi> Chapiter of the seconde of the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, That the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> lamented the death of <hi>Iosias.</hi> But this me seemeth to be a verie weake reason. For certes, this is out of all doubt, that <hi>Ieremie</hi> had manie griefes, and in his dolourous life, made many Lamentations: aswell because of the greeuous sinnes of the people, and their hardnesse of heart: as also by reason of the desolations which he fore sawe: and otherwhile, eyther for the death of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> or else for some other good and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orous men. Alas, howe this good seruaunt of God powred out sighes and riuers of bloudie and bitter teares, as amonge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:176914:8"/> thinges in the ninth, <hi>10.12.14.</hi> and <hi>20.</hi> Chapiters of his Prophesie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
            <p>But it is one thing to Lament for some particular accidentes, or for the death of a <hi>Iosias,</hi> for whome all the people, and all the singing men and singing women lamented: and an other thing to bewayle the whole destruction and ouerthrowe of an Estate and Kingdome, yea, and that of the moste famous and Noble Citie that then was in all the worlde, and which was, as it were, the verie Theater of all the most rare and singular fauourers of the Lorde, which verely deserueth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse treatise, and such especiall Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as in this booke wee see: and it is, J say, a good thing to see, how the Prophet had hereunto in these lamentations a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall regarde.</p>
            <p>The other reason, which they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre these Lamentations to the dayes of <hi>Iosias,</hi> is the place in the fourth of these Lamentations, where mention is made of the taking of the annoynted of the Lorde. Vnder whose shadowe, the people sayde, they should liue, among the Heathen. But in this reason there seemeth no probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because that King <hi>Iosias</hi> was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb facs="tcp:176914:9"/> but hurt, and foorthwith carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by his people, where he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately died.</p>
            <p>Other later learned interpreters seeme to followe an opinion betweene both, that they might reconcile both the one and the other, saying, that in very deede the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and first occasion of the myseries of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and Lamentations of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> was the death of the valiant king <hi>Iosias,</hi> but that notwithstanding these Lamentations exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded euen to the going forwarde of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which continued vnto the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the vtter ouerthrowe of all <hi>Iudah.</hi> As in verie deede after the death of <hi>Iosias,</hi> there was no great quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in <hi>Iudah,</hi> but that great and huge billowes of all sortes of myseries arose one in an others necke, because, as in the <hi>34.</hi> chapter of the seconde of the Chronicles we reade, that hardly could the horrible furie of God his iustice, which <hi>Manasses, Iosias</hi> his predecessor, had prouoked, be appeased: such a fearefull thing it is once to fall into the hands of the Almightie, and to force his patience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioachas,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iosias</hi> reigned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three monethes. After him, the king of <hi>Aegypt</hi> established <hi>Ioachim,</hi> king: whom <hi>Iechonia</hi> succeeded and in his dayes, the
<pb facs="tcp:176914:9"/> Babylonians spoyled the citie, and soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destroyed it, by reason of <hi>Zedechia</hi> his rebellion. Thus we see that after the death of <hi>Iosias</hi> there was nothing, as it were, but a full and through continuance of miseries.</p>
            <p>But seeing J am freely to speake my minde, which of their opinions is most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, J willingly yeelde to them, that thinke these Lamentations of <hi>Ieremie</hi> not to bee so much a prophesie, or a denunciation, or portrayture of a thing to come, as a sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, greeuing, and complayning of a most notorious and euident extreame present ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie: whether it was that <hi>Ieremie</hi> wrote them in pryson, whiles the citie was a sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: or whether it was that he put them in writing sythence, whiles he was with <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doliah</hi> in <hi>Masphat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, at the verie first entrance,<note place="margin">Iere. 40.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of euerie Chapter, hee lamenteth not any particular accident, but a generall ruine and deluge of myseries, which fell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole countrie: to be short, a totall turning vp side downe as well of the citie of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (which <hi>Plinie</hi> himselfe hath placed in the ranke among the chiefest Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the East) as also of the whole seruice and worship of God: likewise of the ciuill policie, and of the whole gouernement both spirituall and temporall: a thing, which is
<pb facs="tcp:176914:10"/> able mightily to wounde true setled heartes, to see the couenaunt of GOD, as it were frustrated, and the right religion derided and reproched, whiche hath mooued the Prophet to aggrauate, and engraue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this notable Booke, for Posteritie to come, all these disorders, and confused dealinges: to the ende to cause the people that then were, and the generation that should come after, feele the wrath and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God his iust vengeaunce, and howe foolishe they are, that giue their mindes to hearken vnto priuie deceauers and false Prophetes, which lulle worldlinges asleepe in their sinnes, and fourde them on in a vaine hope, as though God for the loue of the outwarde temple, for the loue of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for the loue of an outward profession, and for the loue of the name of the Church, should surcease the execution of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mō reward for plaine and sound dealing.</note> as the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> were often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too too much falsely deceaued by these enchauntments: wishing to good <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that dealt plainly and faithfully with them an euill death, because hee soundely and roundly tolde them of the mischiefe which hunge ouer their heades, and because also, that for their daily exceeding in all kindes of sinnes, they must looke for none other paiment but vtter desolation. Thus wee
<pb facs="tcp:176914:10"/> see the matter, J saye, which the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> heere handled in these Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Nowe hee handeleth, and setteth it downe in such manner, as that the whole Booke seemeth rather to bee his Historie, than a foretelling of a thinge to come: hee so liuely and earnestly pictureth out and setteth before our eyes all sortes of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or else all the occurrauntes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstaunces of this Lamentable destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which the <hi>Assyrians</hi> shall bring to passe, and of the captiuitie aswell of the Princesse, as of the people. True it is, because hee right well knewe, that this shoulde not bee the last destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that in the ende of <hi>70.</hi> yeares, the Lorde God would restore againe the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued people vnto their pleasaunt countrey and restablish both them-selues and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion within their Citie: hee entermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth as it were all ouer holy prayers and consolations, to comforte the heartes of good menne with-all, to the ende they shoulde not bee vtterly discouraged, and hopelesse. Nowe, the like comfortes and promises the Jewes had not in the laste siege and destruction, when <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> came against them: For at that time, the Prophetes of GOD gaue
<pb facs="tcp:176914:11"/> them cleane ouer, because their wickednesse was come now to the full ripenesse, when as they vtterly reiected and crucified the great Prophet of Prophetes, and the Doctor of Doctors, Christ Iesus our Lorde, banished, murdered, and persecuted his Prophetes: and to be short, would not vnderstande the time of their visitation. And thus much as touching the argument of the Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Now followeth, that we consider of the Methode or order, and artificiall handling of this writing: which no man can suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admire, if he looke well to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, although the Orators haue nere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found out and inuented many wayes and mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, eyther for the highly commending of any great and excellent thing, eyther else for the bewayling or lamenting of certaine sorrowes and griefes, which kinde of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing Tully in the <hi>3.</hi> of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, reputeth to be the most rich and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and most profitable kinde of order for common-weales: yet the fardle of mans elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, commeth nothing neere the nature and dexteritie of the Lamentations, which the spirite of God hath framed in <hi>Ieremie</hi> his heart, and vttered foorth by mouth to the vse of all the Hebrewes. And although in this Treatise, the Prophet enterlaceth
<pb facs="tcp:176914:11"/> prayers and exhortations to repentance, &amp; withall consolations: yet they are all so pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall, or of such notable feeling as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: and it is the principall scope whereat he aimeth, to discouer, in lamenting the geatnesse of God his wrath, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the greatnesse of the iniquities and sinnes of the people, that they might serue him, as it were for matter and woode, to set such a fire on a light flame. Moreouer, the Prophet so Lamenteth the case, as that hee keepeth him-selfe still within his limites, without soaring a-loft in the ayre in long discourses, which haue not the grace, so liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to touch mens heartes, as graue, natural, and short sentences, proceeding from out of a sorrowefull and wounded heart, which is vnmeete for long or affected speaches: as this Romaine Oratour <hi>Tullie</hi> also testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, It is an hard matter, sayth he, to keepe men long while in a very passioned behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any myserie, because it is a thing that sooner dryeth vp, than the teares of a mans eyes. And such are the stile, and words of the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> in these Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that is to saye, graue, and feeling,</p>
            <p>Beautified with liuely portraytures, and verie fitte comparisons, which lead the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders euen vnto the behoulding of the verie same thinges that are spoken of. If then
<pb facs="tcp:176914:12"/> by the art Oratorie, mens heartes are made flexible to compassion, when as there shalbe tould and figured out vnto them, the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine chaunges and reuolutions from great prosperitie to extreame beggerie, from an high estate, vnto a base and myserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: then of verie right ought a man to be mooued by these Lamentations of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:</hi> which art is aswell practized here, as any Oratour in the worlde is able. And it is a great deale lesse suspected, because hee lamenteth not any particular mishappes, but the spoyling of an whole countrey, and the verie ruine thereof. And this J say, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> so artificially and orderly handleth, as that it is no maruel that <hi>Gregorie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene</hi> wrote as he did, when he sayde: That hee neuer reade the Lamentations of <hi>Ieremie</hi> without teares. And to say the truth, who would not be mooued to see these holy Lamentations, proceeding from the loue of God: the loue of a mans Countrey: the loue of pure and holy Religion: the loue of order and policie: the loue of his fellowe Citizens, and of so many &amp; so many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who with a worlde of young children are seene lead in exile, or else to the shambles, and euerie estate turned vpside downe. For, the greater, the more surpassing, and the more singular that the benefits of God were
<pb facs="tcp:176914:12"/> vnto the Citie of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable was her destruction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was verie well sayde of <hi>Tully,</hi> when he sayde, That there was nothing more to be pitied, then to see a man that hath beene in great prosperitie, and aduaunced to high degree of honour, to be cast downe into great myserie and pouertie.</p>
            <p>Nowe, although in verie deede, a man shal here and there meete with many mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges and lamentations in the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as among the rest, with that which we reade in the first of the <hi>2.</hi> of Samuel, where <hi>Dauid</hi> hartely and tenderly mourned and lamented for the death of King <hi>Saul:</hi> most affectionately bewailing the lamentable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture which came to passe in the mount <hi>Gelboa:</hi> yet shall we finde nothing so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, serious, and enriched with all sortes of excellent comparisons, neither yet grounded vppon so great and manifest reasons, as are the Lamentations of <hi>Ieremie:</hi> about which, are fiue whole Chapters spent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any superfluous kinde of matter in them, but diuersely handled with manie excellent and straunge protractions, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishing sometimes mens mindes with asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and casting them downe, as it were, into a bottomlesse depth, &amp; sometimes againe raysing thē vp, into an hope of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:176914:13"/> grace and fauour, bringing them thereby, vnto true and vnfeyned repentance. But all set out with a most comely grace: represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting first of all in generall, the miseries of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> vnder the person of a poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate widdowe, or of a Princesse, suddenly throwen downe from the highest degree of honour, into a most miserable seruile estate. And after all this, there are liuely represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the tryumphes and braueries of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, by which they thought to breake euen the very heart stringes of these mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable afflicted people.</p>
            <p>In the seconde chapter, the Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to particularize euerie charge, and to descifer by piece meale, the notablest losses that that countrey of <hi>Iudah</hi> had, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Egyptians at that time, furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously entred, and chiefely and aboue all the rest he bewayleth, as a man would saye, the losse of the two eyes, and two perles of the countrey, which are Religion, and politicke gouernement, The order of Priesthoode and kingly state: dolefully lamenting their scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, and the rest of the thinges depending vpon them as the ruine of the Prophetes, Nazarites, fortresses, castles, and such other like thinges.</p>
            <p>Jn the thirde chapter, the Prophet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpō him, the person of the people, very
<pb facs="tcp:176914:13"/> fitly expresseth &amp; representeth the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conflictes, which the poore afflicted soules in their great distresses were wont to suffer together with the issue &amp; victorie, which the faithfull through faith obtayned.</p>
            <p>The fourth Chapter setteth out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and layeth open a way and meanes to heale the wound, by setting down a forme of free confession of sinnes. For, the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to heale a wounde, it to haue a through feeling of the griefe and paine, and after to seeke the remedie. The Prophet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in this chapter, addeth a propheticall foretelling of the destruction of the enemie: thereby continually to ease the wounde and sore of the Jewes, and aduaunce their hope.</p>
            <p>Jn the fifte Chapter, wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremie</hi> concludeth &amp; endeth his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, there is a verie fitte and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie prayer, to keepe all the poore people at once, in all humilitie and true contrition: and likewise in a sure trust and hope of their deliuerance. Thus we see, that after he had throughly lamented and sorrowed, yet that he must at last be driuen to this point, euen in the middest of these extreamest desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to bring our heartes and mindes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto this great God, that quickneth the dead, and who indeed is such a Surgeon,
<pb facs="tcp:176914:14"/> as that there is no wound nor sore but he can heale, when as in a true and liuely fayth, he is sought vnto, and called vpon. Moreouer, we are here especially to note one thing, that whensoeuer the Prophetes summon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to repent, or appease the wrath of God, they neuer sende men to their owne satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or merites, but to the only free mercie of this good God: And <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon <hi>Luke,</hi> rightly speaking of <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> sayth in this sorte: I reade (sayth he) in the Gospel of <hi>Peters</hi> teares,<note place="margin">Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendes in teares, and not in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</note> but nothing of his satisfactions. Thus wee some what plainly see, what is to be noted touching the order and continuation of the Chapters of these Lamentations.</p>
            <p>Some greatly maruell why <hi>Ieremie</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this sort made these Lamentions, seeing the Lorde God in the <hi>16.</hi> Chapter of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, ver. <hi>5.</hi> sayde thus vnto him: <hi>Thou shalt not enter into the house of mourning, neyther shalt thou goe to lament for them; for I haue taken my peace from this people, saith the Lord: and so haue I also my mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, &amp;c.</hi> But here we are to note in the first place, that the Lorde forbiddeth him not simply to lament: but yet so lament, &amp; to such an ende, as that the iudgementes of god against the people might not take effect:
<pb facs="tcp:176914:14"/> As if God should haue sayde thus: Thou hast lamented fairely but it will not serue, for this people must needes be chastized. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our God in this place alleaged, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not vtterly to take away hope of grace from his people: But speaketh of that that should generally fall out vnto the people, and to the obstinate and rebellious multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who altogether hardened their hearts against the Lorde, So that the Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ieremie</hi> were not written so much for him, as they were written to serue the peoples turne, &amp; to be vnto them as a glasse to beholde their miseries in: and a paterne of true and pitifull mourninges, following true repentance and conuersion vnto the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together good and almightie God.</p>
            <p>Whilest we are nowe in speaking of the Lamentations, wee are to note by the way, that the foure first Chapters are written ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrewe alphabet, saue that in the <hi>3.</hi> Chapter, there are sometimes moe verses contained in euerie letter. This order of the Alphabet, is kept also among some of the Psalmes. <hi>S. Ierome</hi> thought it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the poesie, and trauelled to define what kinde of verses they were, and in the ende he tooke the lamentations to bee such kinde of verses, as are called Saphique, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging for testimonies <hi>Origene,</hi> &amp; <hi>Philo</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:176914:15"/> the Jewe: and yet he himselfe in his preface vpon <hi>Isaiah</hi> affirmeth, that the Prophetes wrote in plaine prose. And although in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed the Iewes vsed poesie, which <hi>Reuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> and <hi>Munster</hi> in our time, haue verie carefully and painefully laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: yet the moste parte of the learned and wiser sorte say, that no man is able at this day certainely to shewe any poesie, or kinde of verse which the Jewes vsed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may as yet haue their poeticall accentes. And it should seeme, that when the harmonie of their commonwealth and estates was dissolued, their fine musicque and poesie, withall their excellent singing notes, were eftsoones lost and quite ouerthrowen with the temple of Jerusalem. Thus we see what a thing it is, not to agree and be at one with the great God of heauen, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe our selues from his seruice and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Jt should seeme that this order of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the verses with the Alphabet, is obserued for breuities sake of the graue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences entersuing, which are of maruelous weight, and for the better imprinting of them in memorie, and the making of those sentences to be as familiar as the Alphabet it selfe: without some wrangling companie will start vp and saye, that the Prophet, by running through the whole Alphabet, ment

            <p>It remayneth now, that we speake of the latter point of this preface, which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the vse of the Lamentations of Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and the fruit and commoditie which all the faithfull may gather out of them.

<pb facs="tcp:176914:16"/> a figure and type of the Church of God: And againe, Ieremie aimed at an other maner of marke, than did either the heathen Poets, or historiographers, because he did it to this end to make mē trēble vnder the iust iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and hange downe their heads before his Maiestie, that hee might bring them vnto true repentance. To be short, he squared &amp; seasoned his Lamentations with an assured faith and hope of Gods fauour, and with verie excellent and well knit and conioyned prayers, thereby to pricke men forwarde to returne vnto the Lorde, whome they had offended.</p>
            <p>But if there be any that would finde fault with vs and say,<note place="margin">An obiecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.</note> that the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> himselfe once passed his limites, when a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But be it that we did graunt, that <hi>Ieremie</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:176914:17"/> sore troubled in mind, and that he sustained some temptation: yet it appeareth that hee was not swallowed vp therof: but kept such a temperaunce in his lamentations, as that he grieued no man, neyther shewed any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite against the Lorde: but rather all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto his Maiestie.</p>
            <p>And as for that which the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the <hi>9.</hi> of Jeremie, ver. <hi>17. 18. That they should call for the mourning wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and sende for the skilfull women to take vp a lamentation, and cast out teares vnto the people:</hi> No whit fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vaine and fained worldly lamentations and hired mourners, whom the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themselues laughed to scorne: howbeit these phrases of speech; are vttered as it were scoffingly, to awaken the people, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paint out the wonderfull hardnesse of their heartes, which was such as that they were faine to hire, and cause come, all the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning men and women of the worlde, to make them shed teares.</p>
            <p>In verie deede it is good that a meane be kept in all things, as on the one side to keepe vs from hypocrisie, and from fayned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue sorrowing: &amp; on the other side, from that Stoike blockishnesse.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:176914:25"/> which are verie significant, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward speake somewhat of the chiefe and principall matters.</p>

And some other learned inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretors are of the opinion, that this word is to be vnderstood and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not only in euery member of the first verse, as, <hi>How doth the Citie remaine solitarie? How is she that was great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now as a Widow? How is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse become tributarie?</hi> but also in the beginning of all the four first verses: <hi>How weepeth she day and night? How is Iudah carried away captiue? &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A man were neuer able to expresse how effectuall and proper, vpon the sudden and first entrance, these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations are, immediatly to rauish mens minds to the beholding and considering of any thing, so that this very well agreeth with that which the Lord foretold in the 19. of Ieremias, vers. 3. saying: <hi>Thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Jsrael, Behold, J will bring a plague vpon this place, the which whosoeuer heareth, his eares shall tingle.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176914:26"/> taken in good part, as to be at rest and peace: As in the fourth Chapter of the first booke of the Kings, vers. 25. <hi>All the daies of Salomon, euery man remayned without feare vnder his vyne, and vnder his figge tree, &amp;c.</hi> But in this text it is taken in ill part, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the great sorrow wherein the Iewes were then plunged: resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a widow remaining or dwelling in the world, in her sorrowfull and comfortles widowhood. And as the Hebrewes also deriue the name of a widow, from a word which signifieth solitarines, and a quiet or peaceable bodie, that taketh no pleasure in tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nor scoffing: which word or title, properly belongeth to widowes, that are in very deede widowes, and haue a feeling of their plague and miserie. So that to compare the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Iudah to a widow, is to verie good purpose, considering that it was in deede a widow, because it had neither citizens, nor yet other men of better qualitie: for so much as they are, as it were, the husbands of all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Townes, and do both beawti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye, and giue them estimation and credit.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> On the other side, the Iewes came short of their reckoning, when as they thought to maintaine themselues in their greatnes, and florishing estate, without to be supported by the grace of God, and the keeping of his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts and ordinances, according as the alliance which was made with them required: and ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, because they extreamely exalted themselues in pride and arrogancie, for the which, the Prophet Sophonie in his second Chapter, verse 15. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the Citie of Niniuie, saying: <hi>Behold (saith the Lord) this is the reioycing Citie that dwelt carelesse, that sayd in her hart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she made waste, and the lodging of the beastes?

                     <p>Now, the summe and cause of their miseries and woes, yea, and of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> finall destruction, and of the vtter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe of all the Countrey of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, was, because they would not knowe the time of their visitation.

                     <p>As for the complaint which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Prophet Ieremie maketh, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem was made tributarie, it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth no whit the opinion of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, who imagin that the Church of Iesus Christ, the new Ierusalem, is freed from all tributes and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For there is heere another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to be had in respect of the Iewes, who from the beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were reuolted from the King of kings, were priuiledged to pay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord but one halfe shekle,<note place="margin">Exod. 30. verse. 13.</note> but after they had cast off the yoke of the Lord, and desired to haue kings and princes as other people had, the Lord gaue power, not only vnto their owne kings to taxe them, but also vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strange princes, thereby to beate downe their pride and presumption.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176914:31"/> Heere is then to be noted, that the Gospell ouerthroweth not the ciuill gouernement and order that is vsed at this day, seeing that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe paid tribute money, as in the seuententh verse of Saint Mathew we reade. And Saint Paule also in the thirtenth to the Romaines exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs therevnto, although it were to be wished, that they would not so plucke the wooll from the sheepes backe, as if they were fleaed, neither yet so gather hearbes, as if they would plucke vp both roote and rinde. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, tribute money was besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to an especiall end, which is, for the defence of Countreys, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Iustice, towards the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of which things Princes haue tribute money graunted them.</p>
                     <p>One of the notable doctrines of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> this first part, and as it were through the whole booke of Ieremies Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is an excellent example what it is to serue God,<note place="margin">To serue God sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, is the store-house of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarivvise, the losse of all his blessings.</note> and what to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the true seruing of him. For in truth, to serue God sincerely, is to rule and raigne, and the verie store-house of all happines: Contrarywise, to contemne the seruice of God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176914:32"/> his graces ill, to turne our backs vpon him, to abuse the name and title of Religion, is the cause of all our hinderances and losses, and causeth all our brauerie, glorie, and excellencie to be taken from vs: and to be short, to make vs be spoyled of all blessings, but namely, of this blessing, for the which the people mourne and sorrow, to wit, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude both of old and yong people: as Salomon also witnesseth, saying: <hi>In the multitude of the people is the honor of a King,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prou. 14. verse 28.</note>
                        <hi>and for the want of people commeth the destruction of the prince.</hi> For I pray you tell me, what are Cities and townes, what are kingdomes and prouinces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out men? Aristotle in the third booke of his Politiques, sayeth, that it is neither the walles nor stones that make Cities, but the Citizens and inhabitants. Now when GOD is angrie, he dispeopleth kingdomes, causeth neighbours become meere strangers, driueth friends farre off, plucketh from vs all fauour and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And it is no maruell though God many times maketh vs feele the vnfaithfull dealing of men, or else
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176914:32"/> their vanitie, weakenesse, and miserie,<note place="margin">God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diuers vvaies by their friends, allies, and citizens, vvhen as they make idoles of them.</note> considering that we oftentimes make verie idoles of our friends, allies, and citizens. And as Saint Augustine vpon the 146. Psalme very wel saith, that we so much presume vpon men, and trust so much vnto them, as that if any bring vs tidings that such a Prince, or such a Citie will ioyne with vs in friendship, we are in a maruellous glorie, and make great bonefyers:<note place="margin">A signe and token of great infidelitie, vvhich at this daie reigneth euen in those go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments vvhich vvould seeme to be most religious.</note> but when all the whole scripture shall tell vs that the God of hostes is on our side against all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer whatsoeuer, we are cold in that, and care not, nor yet once reioice as we ought.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, there are many degrees and kinds of calamities, which the Prophet Ieremy bewaileth: but the highest and lowdest complaint that he maketh, is the ouerthrowing of the seruice of God, the making no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the Sabboth and festiuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> daies. And he hath great reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for, the holie assemblies and festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall daies are, alas, other manner of festiuall daies, then were the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piall and pithiall assemblies and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuall dayes, wherein the heathen
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176914:33"/> feasted and sported in the honor of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter &amp; of Apollo. But in the Church of God, his seruice is brought in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, who hath manifested himselfe vnto vs by his wonderful workes, and by his woorde: the exercise also of our fayth, and the spirituall ioy and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in this good God is brought in question, which is a great deale more particularly, certainely and clearely manifested vnto his people, then the Gods of the gentyles,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> who were but diuelish deceiuers amongest the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations. O what a bitter, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, and grieuous thing then is this, to all honest soules that feare God, and haue tasted of the sweetnes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnes of his house, to see such assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies cease, such exercises ouerthrown, and besides all this, the name of God dishonoured, and blasphemed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion laughed at: which is an huge heape of griefe vnto a true Christian heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> Such assemblies I saye, as are not brought in by superstition, or by mans inuention, but by Gods ordinaunce, for the maintenaunce of his seruice, and confirmation of our faith, are highly to be commended: for although the Lord
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176914:33"/> be very wel able extraordinarily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meanes, without preaching, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assemblies to gather vnto himselfe a people yet his will is that his church should here on earth be knowne by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine markes and tokens: his meaning also is to trie our faith and obedience, and to be serued by conuenient meanes to helpe our infirmities, by which meanes hee woorketh, adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto his power: For sithence the sonne of righteousnesse, Iesus Christ hath appeared wee are not charged with so many ceremonies, nor so many feasts as the Iewes were: and being but a fewe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they are as S.

                        <hi>O Lord I haue not hyd my sinnes, but laide them wide open, that thou mightest couer them: I haue not kept them close, because thou shouldest not discouer them:</hi> sayth, That when a man doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them, then God dooth couer them: when a man hydeth them, then God layeth them wide open and when man is readye to acknowledge them, that then our good God pardoneth them.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:176914:37"/> of our sins. As Aegesippus the Historiographer writeth, that Titus, Vespasian his sonne, seeing the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was in Ierusalem: &amp; that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, &amp; partiall dealing herein more preuailed against them, than the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie without: was enforced to protest &amp; say, that it was the reuenging hande of God, and not he that had so vexed them.

                     <p>Moreouer, no man liuing is able to expresse, how many excellent simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes &amp; comparisons the Prophet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie hath collected together in this part, to represent vnto vs the honor &amp; force of the wrath of the most mightie god: as the similitude of the fire which consumeth all thinges: of the spred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a net: of a wine presse: of a yoke that is wrapped: which kindes of speeches doe right well agree, &amp; giue an excellent grace vnto such an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: aswell for the enriching of the

                     <p>SO often as are seene in these lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Ieremy, or in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Psalmes of Dauid, as in the 74. Psalme ver. 1. it is said, <hi>Why hast thou O Lord so long forsaken vs, &amp; left vs to the wilde worlde?</hi> And as in the 79. Psalme, ver. 1. <hi>O Lord, the Gentiles inuade thine enheritance:</hi> that the ancient Fathers with so many greeuous grones &amp; bitter teares, sorowed for the Temple of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalē, &amp; were so sotrangly greeued and vexed for the destruction of it, which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:176914:38"/> was but a materiall temple and figure of the true Church: let vs learne how to lament and sorrowe when we see the ruine and destruction of the liuely stones, and mysticall bodie of the true Church of Iesus Christ our Lord: and when in steede of the happie signes of the true &amp; pure preaching of the gospel, and of the true vse of the Sacraments, we see nothing else but abhominable idolatries, dissolutenesse, and ryot, and heare nothing else but blasphemies, or fables, eyther sclaunders &amp; lies. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that euerie man in particular ought to be the temple of God, and of his holy spirite: let vs be well aduised to walke in all holinesse and integritie of life: and suffer no vncleane thing dwell therein: which was also decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; figured, by that ordinance which the Lord made in 23. of Deutron. ver. 2.3. commaunding that no bastarde, Ammonite, Moabite, or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane body shoulde come within the holy congregation: giuing thereby an infallible aduertisement of the puritie and sanctity which is generally requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bee, as well in the bodie of the Church, as particularly in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:176914:39"/>
                     <p>Ouer and besides this, wee are to note that which is most truly set down in the 2. Chapter of the 1. booke of Samuel, to wit, <hi>That God honoreth those which honour him, and causeth them become infamous which disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him.</hi> Which thing most manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth in the estate of the Iewes. For so long as this mightie God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured them, there was not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Monarch in the worlde but feared them, and regarded their temple and sanctuarie, as in the histories we may reade:<note place="margin">Iosephus in the 8. chap. of his 11. booke.</note> for as Iosephus writeth, wee read that Alexander the great, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Conquerour, when hee was come neere the Citie, and in the rage and heate of his furie and pride, the Lorde suddenly strooke him with such an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and feare, that when he thought to haue tryumphed ouer the Iewes, or to haue attempted some matter against their Citie or temple,<note place="margin">Iosephus in the 8. chap. of his 14. booke.</note> he did Iaddus, the hie Priest that then was, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test honour that a man could do. And besides, that great Romane Captaine Pompey, as hee on a time thought to haue entred into the sanctuarie of the Temple of Ierusalem, he was so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned, as that he touched nothing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:176914:39"/> that was within it but with his eye.<note place="margin">Comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the Church of God.</note> And the progresse of his life and actes was afterwarde full well noted, that after that time, he neuer prospered, nor had any good successe: from that time, I say, that he dared sette foote within the sanctuarie of the Lorde.</p>
                     <p>Nowe the chiefe point that we are to consider of in this third part, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the fearefull wrath of our God, which is amplified and set foorth by so many notable similitudes: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the articles ensuing must be well weighed of vs.</p>
                     <p>The wrath of God,<note place="margin">What the vvrath of God is.</note> as S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine in the 20. Chapter of his 1. booke against the aduersaries of the law and Prophets very substantially teacheth, is not such an heat of a troubled mind, as is in vs poore wretches: but a iust reuenge and punishment for our sinnes: so that the scripture stammereth out, as a man would say, but speaketh vnto vs according to our capacitie in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting vnto God, wrath, furie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. And it is because that wee for the more part, are so blockish, as y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we cannot apprehend as we ought: the greatnes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> diuine Maiestie, neither yet feare his iudgements: &amp; yet surely
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:176914:40"/> his wrath is such a fearefull thing as that neither the consuming fire, nor yet the naming of the most terrible things can at the full sufficiently informe vs of the great vehemency thereof. Thus we see how the Scripture awaketh vs, to make vs conceaue at the least, some little feare of his diuine vengeance, by comparing sometimes the Lorde vnto an hoate consuming fire: as amongest other we may well see in the 32. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Deutron. and in the first Chap. of the Prophet Nahum.</p>
                     <p>Nowe the Scripture doth not only set downe terrible wordes and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, when as it meaneth to paint out the wrath of God: But eftsoones lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before our eyes the terrible effectes and examples of Goddes furie. As a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, the vniuersall deluge in the dayes of Noah: the setting on fire of Sodome, Gomorthe, Adama, Seboim, the captiuitie of Babylon which Ieremie particularly lamēteth: &amp; in summe manie other testimonies of the horrible punishments y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> haue fallen aswell vpon y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bodies of Cities &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces as vpō other in particular, who through their iniquitie haue enforced, &amp; tēpted the Maiesty of the Almighty.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:176914:40"/> For, that which is sayde of the Lorde in 34. Chapter of Exodus. <hi>That hee is slow to wrath, and of great compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, must not be so takē,</hi> as though his goodnesse were decayed, &amp; of no force: but is spoken by way of comparison: because it is an essentiall propertie in God, and wherein he delighteth, to be full of compassion, and to doe good to his creatures: as in the seconde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the lawe it is written: that although he on the one side punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the thirde and fourth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet that hee is mercifull vnto a thousande generations in them y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> feare him, and keepe his commaundements. And this would soone become of vs, if God would rigorously pursue vs: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any one of his creatures so mightie and strong, as that would not be soone ouerthrowen and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And as for the wrath of God and his vengeance: we must alwayes hold this <hi>maxime</hi> or ground: that it is most iust: For as Paule in the 1. to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes ver. 18. sayth: <hi>That the wrath of God is reuealed &amp; made seen from heauen, against all vngodlines.</hi> Which thing Ieremy also confesseth in his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations: That God properly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:176914:41"/> not men and his creatures,<note place="margin">
                           <p>God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth not his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but their sinne that is in them.</p>
                           <p>The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is betvven the chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the elect, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the reprobate, Rom. 9. Euery smal sinne hath sufficient matter in it selfe to kindle the wrath of God: but Idolatrie, pride, the vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the thinges of this vvorld, crueltie, &amp; inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, set it on a light flame.</p>
                        </note> but the extreme sinne and iniquitie which he findeth in vs. And although bothe the elect and reprobate, and wicked worldlinges be punished heere in this worlde: yet is there a great difference betweene the one and the other: For the children of God are corrected and chastised for their learning, and not for their destruction: and are assured to be deliuered frō the euerlasting wrath of God, as Paule in the 1. Chapter of the first to the Thessalonians teacheth vs. But the wicked and reprobate are called the vesselles of yre, prepared to destruction.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer we may knowe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by these Lamentations of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie and other places of the scripture that although euerie sinne may serue for matter and sparkes to kindle the wrath of God: yet is it singularly lette on fire through ydolatrie: pride, and the vaine confidence in the thinges of this worlde: and through crueltie and inhumanitie, which make vs reuolt from our God: and engender in our heartes a contempt of his word. Such were the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nabath: of Achab also &amp; Manasses:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:176914:41"/> and their sinnes aforesaide also, haue from them, begotten manie other sins, as licentiousnesse, vanitie, inordinate life, and murmiring against GOD: which sinnes are spoken of in the 78. Psalme, and in the beginning of the 10. Chapiter of the firste to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes.</p>
                     <p>When these sinnes are put togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ouerflowe with a contempt of all the admonitions which the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of God shall giue:<note place="margin">VVhē sins are growē to such a ful ripenes, as that the admonitiō of gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are cōtemned, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the vengeance of God vpon that people that haue so sinned.</note> it is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that the Apostume is growen to a full ripenesse, and will soone breake, and in summe, that the vengeance of God will not be long behinde. As we may in verie deede often times see, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great and cruell warres, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame desolations, or else deadly plagues, eyther else barrennes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine accompanied with all manner of miseries: and among the rest, the death of good and famous men, and of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were the Nurses of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Churches: and so of such examples, alas, there are too too manie in our dayes.</p>

                     <head>THE OBSERVATIONS OF the last parte of the first Chapter.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this part is partly cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, complaintes: partly, prayers and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions vnto God: part<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly reproches to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Thus we see how that in our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series we may be suffred to accuse ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our sinnes, or else the crueltie of our enemies: but neuer the Almighty. And therefore it was verie well sayde of that heathen man Tully in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde booke <hi>of the nature of Gods:</hi> That it is a most wicked custome to dispute and reason against God: either in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest or in iest. Euen so here, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet no whit blameth the Maiestie of God, or his iudgements: but seemeth rather in this parte, to preuent those that would go about to aske this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. Is God therfore vniust or cruell, in so horrible punishing his people the Iewes? No surely saith he: for although
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:176914:43"/> scarsely shal a mā see the like affliction and like losses, if thinges bee weighed according to their valure: yet we can not chose but take them to be for our disobedience and rebellions. So that it is iust in God, and open confusion &amp; shame in vs: as in the 9. verse of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel his prophesie it is written.</p>
                     <p>And in that the Prophet directeth his speech,<note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of God.</note> sometimes to one sort and eftsoones to another: he doth it as mē amazed doe, who knowe not which way to turne them, seeking all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons possible to discharge and vnburdē their mindes. It is verie true, that one while he desireth God to looke vppon the matter, and an other while, men and strangers: For, in desiring to haue our good God to beholde it: who by his onely looke healeth all our griefes and myseries, as in the 42. Psalme, ver. 5. is sayde: <hi>That he waiteth by a sure faith for his ayde and regarde, which is full of power and force:</hi> And yet hee thinketh not, but that it is to great purpose also, that other people should beholde the myserie. First, because that when anie looke pitifully vppon vs, it somewhat mytigateth our sorrowes and griefes. Secondly, because euerie man is so to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:176914:43"/> looke into examples, and as that hee may thereby learn to be wise by other mens harmes, and think, that asmuch hangeth ouer his owne heade, as ouer any other. The Historiographer Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius writeth, That he stoode hard by Scipio the Romane Captayn his side, who destroyed Carthage, whilest the same City was on a flaming fire, and that when Scipio sawe it so burne, hee began foorthwith to weepe: although it had beene the Citie, that had long time made head against the Romans: whereupon, Scipio beeing asked why he then wept: aunswered, that when he called to minde the reuolutions &amp; chaunges of the worlde, he perceiued that all kingdomes &amp; Cities had their turnes and stratagemes, and that it wold one day come to passe that Rome also would be set on fire. To be short, there is no doubt, as the Poet Iuue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall writeth in certain verses, but that the great Creator of the whole world hath giuen vnto vs tender hearts, and fountaines of teares, to bewayle the sorrowfull estate of our friendes, or neighbours.</p>

For the Babylonians had also their course and stratageme, which thou mayest see in the 13. &amp; 14. of Esaiah. But all thinges considered, it is like the interpretation which we haue folowed, to be least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, &amp; to haue a more large scope: seeing that in the Hebrewe text it is thus worde for worde: Thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, named, and determined the day: but they shalbe like vnto me. And therefore this should be no very good sence, to say: thou hast made come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the pronounced day.</p>

But it is ynough that we know that there is no permanent kingdome saue the kingdome of our God: and that the creator hath ordayned vnto all Kingdomes, Prouinces, and Cities, a sure and certaine ende, certaine and sure punishments, chaunges &amp; signes, vpon which it were better for vs to lay holde, as wee are taught by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to come by reason of our sinnes, dissolutenesse of life, and such other like signes, then by the constellation of the starres, or any certaine Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall number and proportion.</p>

Howbeit, I gladly yeelde to their opinion, which referre this vnto the wickednesse of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For the scripture speaketh after
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176914:45"/> this manner, that God setteth before him the sinnes of all such as hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to punish. S. Ierome giueth vs to wit, that this is not here takē so much for an imprecation or curse: as it is for a kinde of prophecie, of that which shall fall vppon the enemies. This is true, that it is no newe thing, to read in the Prophetes, of the curses they pronounce, not in their owne priuate names, or according as flesh &amp; bloud directeth them: but according as the spirite of God guideth them, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it into their mouthes: and to this end for the which we dayly pray and saye, <hi>Thy kingdome come:</hi> and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that all thinges contrarie to his will, be brought to naught.</p>

For Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose writing to one Iustus in the viij. booke of his Epistles, sayth thus: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (sayth he) it were graunted that the Prophetes wrote nothinge Rhetorically, yet must wee needes confesse and say that they wrote ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the gift of the grace of the spirite of God, which surpasseth all arte and knowledge. In so much as it it is to be presumed, that the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Orators haue borrowed many
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:176914:52"/> thinges of the holy scriptures, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such, as might any way come by the bookes to reade thē. For are there any passions, descriptions, compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and such other like thinges ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or appertayning for or to anie matter or purpose, whereby to mooue and stirre vp the heartes and mindes of men, which are not to be founde in these Lamentations? Namely in this seconde Chapter, which, as the first Chapter beginneth with this woorde ECHA: to wit, HOW: euen so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doth this, and hath also the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses diuided according to the order of the Hebrewe Alphabet.</p>
                  <p>Nowe this Chapter is diuided into two principall partes. The first is drawen downe in the first twelue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and beginneth moste fearefully sette foorth in such wordes, as if the heauen and starres would fall, and the Elementes melt. And therefore wee may see, that the Prophet heere wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth an higher stile, and proceedeth more pathetically or feelingly, than he did in the former. And this method or order of his, is also verie resolute. For first, he at once speaketh of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in generall, and afterwarde parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culariseth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:176914:52"/> all the members and partes thereof. The bodie and whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the matter, was the Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall Estate: the Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Nobilitie, and Priesthoode, or ministerie of the Church. Where this beginning to be shaken and fall, the estate of the Countrey is in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable case: and the Ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment being troubled and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, Religion abyeth for it, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that common-weales, as Plato in his bookes of lawes writeth, are as it were an house established by GOD, or an Inne and place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of manie laudable and holie lawes, ordinaunces, and good and honest studies, in so much that all good and godlie men are iustly gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when as they see the estate and policie of kingdomes troubled and in an vprore. When as the Prophet Ieremie hath generally spoken of these thinges, hee after particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizeth the whole, and descendeth vnto the members and partes, as vnto the palace, fortresses, walles, gates, feastes, Sabothes, Priestes, olde men, and young children, the holie lawes, &amp;c. For, common-weales
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:176914:53"/> stande and are grounded vppon all these partes: in so much that when the Lorde promiseth a restablishment: he sayth among all other thinges, that they shall see in the streates, the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rende fatherly old men sitting in their Gates: and the young children play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the streetes.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:176914:53"/> God, in teares, and sorrowe of heart: seeing that the ende for the which he afflicteth his people, is onely to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and call them to repentaunce: And therefore sythe there was yet a meane and way left to finde grace, and appease him that is naturally pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and who neuer reiecteth those soules which are in deede truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and sorrowefull: there was no better way, than to call vppon his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine goodnesse: as in verie deede in the ende of this Chapter hee setteth downe before them a short forme of heartie and earnest prayer.</p>

                        <hi>He hath not remembred his footestoole.)</hi> This is a kind of speech borrowed from the manner of men, for, we right well know, that God, who is a spiritual substance, hath no neede of a foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole. But by this allegoricall manner of speach, is meant the Temple, in which they saw the signes and tokens
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:176914:56"/> of God his presence. The earth also in comparison of heauen, which is the throne of the heauenly maiestie, is sometimes called, as in the 66. of Esay we reade, <hi>The footestoole of the Lord.</hi> But when the Temple is so called, it is vppon some other consideration, to wit, because it seemeth that God, as it were abode in that temple, and there testified that he walked among his people. But when the Lord calleth the Temple his footestoole, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to vnderstand, that we should not set our minds vpon the materiall Temple, or take it for the verie dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place of his maiestie, but only for some small testimonie of his presence, and that there is a farre great deale more to be said, betweene his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie glorie, and the shining glorie in the Temple, as may be spoken of a kinglie throne and a footestoole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the people should alwaies lift vp their hearts on hye towards the true Throne of glorie.</p>

The Chaldee interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is thus, They were led away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they regarded not the lawe. But in mine opinion, this place is rather to be referred vnto the discord that was then in Ierusalem, and in all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, when as they which should haue been the obseruers of the lawes, and haue kept the people vnder discipline, were either dead, or else led captiue. Heere then is represented vnto vs the sorrowfull countenance of a people,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:176914:57"/> voide of good direction and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the verie office and dutie of all Magistrates, is, to mainteine the authoritie of the lawes of peace, of the seemely order, and quiet of all Cities and countreys. And it was in elder daies,<note place="margin">22 of the first booke of the Kings.</note> in the raigne of good King Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, an especiall happie time that the booke of the law was found againe, that was so long missing, and troden vnder foote as it were in the time of that wicked infidell king Achas: or at least, as Lyra writeth, was hid in a wall, and found at such time as the Temple was restored. To be short, it is verie well said of the Lawyers, That it is to small purpose to haue lawes and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in Cities, if there be not also qualified men to render to euery man his right, and to execute iustice and iudgement. For we see how that in the daies of Ieremy the laws of God were of no force, written either in paper, parchment, or tables, seeing that the Prophets, Priests, Iudges, and such as should haue been the life of the law vnto the people were either dead, or scattered. Theodoret in the 15. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his first booke of his Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call historie, alleageth what an holie
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:176914:58"/> ordinance the Emperour Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine the great had made, which was this, that he caused the holy bookes of the holy scripture to be copied out, for the which, at his fyrst entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Empire, he was highlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: to the end they might euery where he read, that thereby the will of GOD might be vnderstoode and knowne: where contrarywise, that curssed Iulian pretended nothing more, then the suppressing of them. And we see that among the Turkes and barbarous nations, all good lawes and holie bookes are made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of, and such beastlines establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, as that the people haue no knowledge of the word of God, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet of any other good lawes esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Christian Emperours: and therefore we see alas, that ciuil warres bearing sway, euery thing is abased, so that there is neither rule nor law, but the violence and will of the most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and mightiest men, a thing which can not ynough be bewailed with the Prophet Ieremy.</p>

And although we haue no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse histories of the famine that then was, and of that which hapned vnto the yong infants, yet are we not to doubt that the Prophet hath set downe anie thing that came to passe at that time in Ierusalem, otherwise then as Iosephus the historian hath left in writing in the tenth and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Chapt. of his sixt booke of his historie. And besides, we find that in our daies, both at Harlem in Holland, and also at the seege of Sansare in Berrie, in the yere 1573. mothers were brought to great extremities by the like famines. Neither are we to doubt, that famine is one of the most cruell deathes, and one of the most fearefull whips that can be laid vpon vs by the hand of God.

And to say the truth, these are the two most notable lights of the people of God: yea, two of the most notable remembrances of his maiestie, whereupon ensueth, that it is a feareful thing to see such things foyled, and troad vnder foote: which thing, the comicall heathen Plautus doth vs to vnderstand, in bringing in a man, saying: what man is he that is so bold and shamelesse, as dareth do violence vnto a priest. But yet aboue all the rest, the kinglie state and priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood among the people of the Iewes was most honorable, because they figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Messiah, and anointed of the Lord, which should come into the

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:176914:61"/> festiuall daies in the Church, wherein they shew their slouth, and desire of idle life, for such men hunt alwaies after holydaies. Now, the cause why Ieremy lamenteth the Iewes feastes, was not for any loue that he bare to the feastes, but because of the seruice of God that was exercised in them, and by reason of the solemne assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies that were vsed there in those daies. But the Papists feasts which the Popes ordeined for the honor of creatures, and many other Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous deuises, full of riot and excesse, haue no more communitie with the holy feasts of the lawe, then had Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus feastes. If then, as it is written in the first of Isaiah, it be said of the feastes which God himselfe expressely ordeined: <hi>I hate your solemne feasts: my soule abhorreth your new moones because you abuse them, and because the people looke to nothing else but to the outward shew.</hi> What would the Prophets at this day say, if they sawe these superstitious and riotous feastes deuised by men, and by nurse mothers, of a thousand and a thousand dissolute things, as by experience we commonly see. So that the festiuall daies of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:176914:62"/> people in the old time were a part and parcell of the ceremonies and schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maistership of the lawe and shadowes, the bodie, and accomplishment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was in Christ, as in the second Chapter of Saint Paule his Epistle to the Colossians it is written: in so much that now at this day no man may, or can binde vs vnto any suche feastes, either condemne or find fault with vs for any such dayes or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths: but we must rather put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the spirituall meaning of the feastes: and that is it which Isaiah, speaking of the later times maketh mention of in the last Chapter of his prophesie, saying: <hi>Let vs make vnto our selues perpetuall Sabboths, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the spirite, and rest from our euill workes, and reioyce in the Lord.</hi> As for the Law, whereof Eusebius in the 24. Chapter of his fourth booke of the Ecclesiasticall historie writeth in the life of Constantine the Emperour by him made, concerning the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the solemne feastes of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres. First of all we must vnderstand, that it can bind no mans conscience, because it is not the ordinance of God,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:176914:62"/> but of man. Secondarily, it was at that time another manner of thing to commend in assemblies the faith and constancie of the Martyres, to the end to stirre vp others couragiouslie to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the name of Christ, then to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate feasts, for the hudlings and roaring out of Masses, or for the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of shod fables and legends, and to passe the day in all vanitie &amp; ryot, as the Papists in their feasts at this daie do.</p>
                     <p>Now Ieremy right well teacheth vs by his example, what a losse it is to lose good lawes and ordinances, and good gouernors: and what a miserie it is, when as there is neither faith nor law to be had, neither yet any good exhortations: and to be short, when as God reuealeth himselfe no more vnto vs. Such was the great misery of king Saul, whē the Lord so withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self frō him,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 28.</note> as y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he neuer more answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him either by prophets or visions.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, we see in this first part of the second Chapter, what a fearefull iudgement of God it is, when as our poore infants do feele his heauy wrath and fierce fury: so that, although we our selues haue no compassion of our
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176914:63"/> selues, yet ought we at least to haue compassion of our tender Infants, vpon whome, for our sinnes, and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious kinde of life, we bring them into those miseries wherein they are wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: not for that this great, good, and mercifull God punisheth the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents which can not do withall,<note place="margin">VVhen God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his crosse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon yong Infants, he doth it not of any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to thē, but to wound the rebellious hearts of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents with such sights to call them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the yong Infants, whome he espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie cherisheth, and maketh much of, as in the first of Deuteronomy, and in the 10. &amp; 18. of S Mathew we reade. But it is his pleasure first of all to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the parents in their owne childrē, being a part of themselues, and their owne flesh: and therefore it is the Lords will to wound and cast downe by such sights, the stubborne and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious harts of such fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers against his holy word. And yet notwithstanding, he is able to discerne his chosen children which are ordeined to euerlasting life, from the reprobate, drawing his chosen in good time vnto himselfe, because they should no more sinne heere in this world: or else he punisheth those children which he seeth still so go on in their fathers wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as we put to death yong woolfe cubbes.

Thus we see why he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aswell of the wrath of God, as of the false Prophets, and iolitie of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie. To be short, he bringeth in the fearefull effects of God his wrath, and runneth through all kindes, ages, and conditiōs, declaring therby, that there was none exempt. And yet he so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the matter, as that his purpose is not to driue men to desperation, but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176914:65"/> rather to cause them seeke the Lord, and to waite for their deliuerance from his hands, as from one who both woundeth and healeth, who leadeth into the pit, and bringeth out againe: and in sending the aforesaid afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Cyprian in his 4. booke of his Epistls the fourth Epistle.</note> will (as Cyprian sayeth) send also the promised deliuerances, and as discipline and correction haue gone before, so also will grace and pardon follow, so that we incessantly crauing, and through faith beleeuing to receiue, do simplie, and with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious minds call vpon the Lord in weeping and groning. Moreouer, the Prophet Ieremy setteth before vs the way how to repent, first, by certaine outward signes, as by weeping, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and lifting vp of the hands, and also by the duties which euerie faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full soule ought to poure out before the Lord.</p>

Now although this seemeth to be an hyperbolicall or excessiue kinde of speech, yet if we weigh all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, we shall fynde that neuer people had so great cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, as the people of the Iewes then had, who right well felt that they had to deale with the liuing God, and that he banded himselfe against them, and had receiued from him more largely, then euer any people else had, and therefore were more astonied at this alteration, which caused Ieremy to redouble these wordes: Consider O Lord to whome thou hast done these things: consider that they are thy chosen people: consider also that it is thy Citie Ierusalem, which thou so highlie esteemedst, that thou hast thus so roughly handled and entreated. Surely there is nothing more hardlie to be borne, then the anger of a deere freend, or of a father. Euen so was this a bitter thing to feele at that time the hand of the heauenly father turned, his countenance altered, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors cōuerted into fury &amp; indignatiō.</p>

And so sometimes are the people of God called, as heere they are, and in the 37.

                        <hi>Prophesies and banishments.)</hi> We haue not so much expressed the words of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:176914:66"/> the Prophet, as we haue his meaning, because his meaning is, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies and visions of the Prophets were banishments, that is to say, that the people sleeping in theyr sinnes, were the cause, what with theyr flatteries, and supposed visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that, they were banished theyr countrey, and fell into so great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and it seemeth in verie deede, that the Prophet had reason to vse this Hebrewe word, which properlie signifyeth an heauie weight, or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denous prophesie: as if he would haue sayde, Surely thy false Prophets haue prophesied of burdens and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments: for although they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be milde and gentle Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and that there were none of the seruants of God but we, that were the greeuous and burdenous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet for all that, the effect hath shewed, that these thy notable Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers haue preached and prophesied such prophesies vnto thee, as haue wayed thee downe to the ground, and are the cause of these burdens, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and afflictions which at this day thou suffrest.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is one of the chiefest pointes that we are here to consider of, to knowe and vnderstande what a mischiefe it is to haue to doe with false Prophetes, who smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vs vp with faire speeches, and flattering vs in our sinnes, doe vtterly destroy vs: And are in verie deede, as S. Peter in his 2. Chapter of his 2. Epistle, calleth them, <hi>welles without water.</hi> Let vs then here note, that it is our greatest auaile and benefite, when as our Pastors and Doctors doe not only instruct vs: but also when as they doe liuely and sharply reproue vs: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it belongeth to their charge so to do, as in the first Chapter of S. Paul his Epistle to Titus wee may reade.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:176914:68"/> For it is good and profitable for vs to bee powdred with the salt of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, because we should not putrifie in our sinnes.</p>
                     <p>For this purpose wee are to weygh and consider the saying of S. Cyprian an auncient Doctor of the Churche, in these wordes: That man (sayth he) that smootheth vp a sinner with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering wordes, giueth him a light bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning torch to sette his sinne on a light burning fire, and in steede of casting it abroade and putting of it out, doth by all meanes possible maintayne and nourish it. But hee which liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth and admonisheth his Brother, furdereth his saluation. Euen so it behooueth euerie minister of the Lord, not by fayre and deceitfull woordes to beguile y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> people: but to prouide whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some remedies for euerie disease. He is a very foolish Chirurgion, that will neatly and tenderly handle inuetered and olde sores. For, he that so fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his pacient, maketh his wounde the worse: &amp; letteth the poyson lye hidd within the infected partes: But hee shoulde open and make incysion of the wound, yea although his patient shold euen whine &amp; byte, and shewe himselfe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:176914:68"/> neuer so impatient by reason of his paine &amp; griefe: but he will, after hee is once whole, giue his Chirurgiō great thāks for his so doing. Ther is at this day a new &amp; straunge crueltie discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when as vnder the title and colour of mercie and compassion, there is brought in pleasaunt poyson, and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease dormant to deceiue the people, &amp;c. Thus wee see what S. Cyprian hath written. S. Barnard also hath written a notable Homely vppon this matter, wherein he sheweth, That an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall person ought, if the case so requireth, to bee both gratious, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ustere. Wherefore it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that they which desire to haue pleasaunt thinges preached vnto them, seeke by al meanes possible their owne destruction, as we may read of them, that are mentioned in the <hi>30.</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Isaiah, who vtterly reiected the hearing of the admonitions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisementes of Gods heauie wrath and indignation. Whereuppon also Ieremie in. the 8. Chapter of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie complayneth, when he speaketh of the false Prophetes, that sclender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dawbed vp and healed the peoples woūds, <hi>Crying vnto thē peace peace,</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:176914:69"/> when in very deede there was no peace at all. <hi>Therefore,</hi> (sayth the Lord) <hi>they shall fall in the day wherein I will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site them:</hi> And in the 4. of Oseah it is sayde, <hi>There is none that will chasten nor reproue one another: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shalt thou stumble in the day and the Prophet also with thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other point which wee are to note, is the scoffing and euill fauoured iesting of the aduersaries, who seeing the calamities of Gods people, as in the 1. of Habacucke it is written, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and waxe proude, offring vnto their nettes, and commending their owne counsels and enterprises:</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they shall buye these their reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinges and iolities full deare. For as our Sauiour Christ in the 23. of Luke ver. 31. sayth: <hi>If this be done to a green tree,</hi> and that the faithfull be afflicted, <hi>what shall be done to the drie,</hi> that is to say, to vnprofitable othes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, what shall the reprobate looke for, but for eternall fire? Ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, we knowe that the wicked can haue no power ouer vs, without it be giuen them from aboue which thing Ieremie putteth vs in minde of, when as hee so often reciteth these wordes:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:176914:69"/>
                        <hi>The Lorde hath caused this to fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, euen as he had determined,</hi> To shewe vnto vs that Tyrantes and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are but God his instruments to doe his will for the chastizing of his owne people, and the executing of his iust iudgement, although they thinke not so, as in the 10. of Isaiah wee read.</p>
                     <p>When the Prophet speaketh of the voice,<note place="margin">Of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarde shewes and gestures of repētance.</note> and of the rest of the gestures of the bodie which are commonly vsed of such as humble themselues before the Lorde: as teares, sighes, hanging downe of the heade, lifting vp of the handes, knocking on the breast, &amp; such like: we are to learne and knowe, that the whole man both in bodie and soule humbleth himselfe, and by such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde signes testifieth vnto vs our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde affection: otherwise, all our gestures &amp; lamentable speeches were verie mockeries, and plaine hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. And therfore it was very well said of Basil, writing vpon this place in the first of Isaiah: <hi>When as they shall lift vp their handes, I will not heare them.</hi> It is no maruell sayth he, For they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone lift vp their hands as they should, which seeke after heauenly thinges:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:176914:70"/> and as a young child, simply lifteth vp his hands vnto his nurse, euen so haue they recourse vnto their God. But the Iewes lifting vp their handes full of violence, vnto the Lord, prouoked him more and more, faring like a man that had slaine a Kinges sonne, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward imbruing his hands in his bloud would then come and shew himself vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King: were this the way to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the Kinges wrath?</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which hath beene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore sayde is very notable, That we must poure out our harts before y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lord, which thing Dauid in his 62. Psalme aduertiseth vs of, saying: <hi>put you trust in him, ô ye people, alwaies, and poure out your harts before him:</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speech giueth vs first of al to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we may frankly and freely tell all our sorrowes &amp; griefes vnto the Lord, and poure out our anguishes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bosome, as a young child would do into the bosome of a most louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Besides, we are aduertised to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of hypocrisie, and to confesse our selues perfectly vnto God, &amp; tell him whatsoeuer lyeth in our hearts. For he it is that soundeth the hearts: and as Dauid in the 51. Psalme saith, <hi>All our

For he dispatched and threwe vp the notablest tabernacles of Iacob, and the holiest Manors which a man would haue thought impregnable, as easily as a man would throwe vp the tent or pauillion of a garden: In so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that whosoeuer had seene these myserable people, would haue sayde that there had neuer beene amonge them, eyther holy assemblies, Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othes, or yet festiuall dayes.

                  <hi>THE THIRD CHAPTER.</hi> The Argument and summe of this Chapter.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Man might saye that this thirde Chapter is the strength, and as it were the verie soule of these Lamentatiōs: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so furnished with such graue sentences, similitudes, and comparisons, as are most apt and meete to mooue mens affections, and thereby driue them to compassion. For although the Prophet handleth the selfe same subiecte or argument which he doth in the Chapters going before: yet he here, more notably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth and garnisheth his style or vaine of writing and more at large amplifieth the miseries of Ierusalem &amp; of the countrey round about: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it seemeth that his meaning is to shewe, that no toung, art, nor compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:176914:75"/> is able sufficiētly to expresse the calamitie thereof: and in very deede, it is impossible for a mā, more affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately, and more eloquently to set it foorth, than he doth.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Prophet in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, speaketh no more in the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, neyther yet in generall, as he did in the beginning of the first Chapter, in the person of a comfortlesse wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe: but speaketh in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: or, as it is most likely, hee bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a certaine person outragiously lamenting, and representing all the people of Iudah: euen as some of the auncient Fathers thought the booke of Iob to be a representation of a man wrestling against most mightie temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and in the ende got the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: although there is more likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode that this booke is an historie of things that came to passe and were done, both by reason of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the places and personnes which are therein particularized. The order of the Alphabet is not heere in ech point folowed, as in the rest of the Chapters. For, there are three verses ioyned to euerie letter, saue that the letter, P H E, is left out.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:176914:75"/>
               <p>As for the poesie that may be in these Lamentations, it is not needefull to haue it curiously sought after, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the most learned interpretors neuer busie nor trouble themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>Now there are in this Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned three principall pointes, the first, reacheth vnto the 20. verse, and is a paterne of an extreame combat betweene the flesh and the spirite, and of a stronge assault which a manne sustayneth, when he is brought into extreame sorrowe and griefe: The like whereof wee may reade in the 73. and 77. Psalmes. For this is most certaine, as Saint Augustine writeth vppon the 60. Psalme, to wit, That we can not liue in this pilgrimage of ours without temptation: because that through temptations wee must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and aduaunce our selues, and no man can know it, without he be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; no man can be crowned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he conquer, neyther can any man ouercome, without hee fight, and no man can fight, without hee haue an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to set vpon him.</p>
               <p>In the seconde parte is contayned the victorie ouer the temptations, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:176914:76"/> the meanes to bridle and abate the impatiencie of our fleshe. In this part, which goeth vnto the 40. verse, are manie excellent sentences, which in this Chapiter glyster like orient pearles. But to bee shorte, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet houldeth vppe these three buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers against all temptations. First of all, he compareth the punishment which they abide, with that, which the people had well deserued, by reason of their sinnes: and so findeth, that in respect, they were verie gently dealt withall.</p>
               <p>Secondarily, he beholdeth &amp; setteth downe the constancie of God, and his great goodnesse, which farre surpasse our small, and momentanie temporall miseries, which, in regarde of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and felicitie that the children of God looke for in the life to come, are of no valure. As in the 4. chapter of the 2. Epistle of S. Paule to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes, we may read.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Ieremie setteth before the peoples eyes, the ende and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of our GOD in his chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, who seeketh not, nor desireth our destruction: but our amendment and saluation: and is wonted by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:176914:76"/> to trie and cleanse those that are his, that he might afterward more amplie bestowe his holy graces vpon them.</p>
               <p>In the third part, from the 40. verse, vnto the ende of the same Chapter is contayned a prayer. For although the faith of the children of god ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the worlde and all temptations: yet the same fayth neuer presumeth or waxeth proude therein: but giueth all the glorie to God alone, &amp; maketh vs also alwaies to call to minde our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, and the stratagemes and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning policies of the deuill: who for a time maketh shewe to depart from vs, that he might therby afterward more fiercely set vpon vs. And therefore we are continually to watch and stande vpon our guard: and according to the counsell of S. Cyprian, be alwaies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to withstand Sathan, as often as he assayleth vs. Now the weapons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we must resist him, are laid before vs in the 6. Chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians.</p>
               <p>Let vs therfore in these latter daies, and most miserable times, make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the doctrines contayned in this chapter, that we may therby together,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:176914:77"/> liuely feele our miseries, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande desperation and impatiencie, to the ende we walke not in the waies of the Apostles, who in the time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction fall away, shewing themselues for a while, to be but shallow Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, much like vnto the seede sowed in the stonie ground, written in the 13 of S. Matthew his Gospell.</p>

                     <p>Now, this first part of the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations rightly setteth foorth vnto vs, howe that this great GOD of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes leadeth his holy ones in to hell, and as it were into a bottomlesse depth of temptations and griefes: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> whosoeuer at the first sight, should heare thē speake after y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> maner, would take them to be desperate men, and voide of all consolation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Such another combate sustained the Prophet Dauid, as in the 77. Psalm
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:176914:79"/> verse, 3.7.8. we reade, when he sayth: <hi>J did thinke vpon God, and was troubled: I prayed, and my spirite was ful of anguish: will the Lorde absent himselfe for euer? Js his mercie cleane gone for euer? And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde I saide, This is my death, &amp;c.</hi> S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine also writing vpō the 91.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit wee may very well see that hee handleth one and the verie selfe same argument, which he handleth in the Chapters going before, albeit he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it downe in another manner of sort, and in an other maner of person. And this is a thing which greatly stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:176914:79"/> vp the readers, when as they heare a people sorrowing and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, one while in the person of a poore desolate widdow, and another while in the person of a man vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably sorrowfull. This also serueth to humble vs, and to make vs more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of the mercie of the Almightie, euen as was the preaching of the law, to the end to beate vs downe, and to prepare vs the more earnestlie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the newnesse of grace.</p>

                     <p>We are therefore to note, that the second part of this Chapter leadeth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:176914:81"/> vs vnto the verie storehouse of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defence of the faithfull,<note place="margin">The store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of munition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> and teacheth vs with what armour and weapon we should fight against such enemies, and how sure and resolute we should be of our God, and of his iudgements. To be short, heerein is shewed vnto vs, that the faithfull must alwaies with the one eye looke vpon their owne miseries, and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vpon the mercies of the Lord, and vnto the right hand of the most high, who turneth all the euents vnto a good end, according to the saying of the Prophet Dauid in his 77. Psalme and 11. verse, for if we should behold and consider nothing else but our owne miserie, it were such a gulfe as would swallow vs cleane vp.</p>
                     <p>The first thing then that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ieremy setteth downe for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paysing of the peoples griefe, is the comparing of the punishments with the sinnes. And forthwith he findeth no equall proportion, for that our sinnes haue without all comparison, deserued greater miseries and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then is possible for vs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in this life. For, we hauing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely offended his diuine and infinite
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:176914:82"/> maiestie, haue all deserued as much as is possible, infinite punishments, yea, euen to be vtterlie destroied: so that it was the wonderfull great grace of God, to leaue in the fiercenesse of his wrath such a number of Israelites as he did, placing them heere and there in passable places, &amp; assuring them by his promise, that he would in the end of seuenty yeeres visit their captiuitie.</p>

                        <hi>Jt is the Lords goodnesse that we are not consumed.)</hi> Some others, as Vatable for one, reade: The mercies of the Lord are not consumed, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, some verie notable men do follow, and seemeth to haue reference to that which followeth, to wit, they are renewed daily. But for mine owne part, I had rather in this place follow the translation of Santes and Treme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, because it agreeth better with the text, and with the literall meaning of the toong. The word to <hi>consume,</hi> in the Hebrew toong signifyeth sometime perfection, and is taken in the good part: but heere it is taken in the worse part, and signifieth, to destroy, as in the fourteenth Chapter of the first booke of the Kings, verse 10. we reade, where it is said, <hi>J will rase the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:176914:82"/> house of Ieroboam, and sweepe it away, as a man sweepeth away doong, till it be all gone and consumed.</hi> Let vs then take the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ieremy heere, as it is taken in the first Chapter of Isaiah, ver. 9. where it is said, <hi>Except the Lord of hoastes had reserued vnto vs euen a small remnant, we should haue beene as Sodome.</hi> Now, the cause that Ieremy alleageth, why the people were not consumed, was, by reason that his compassions failed not. For, although he stay his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites heere for a season, yet do his compassions neuer faile, neither doth the fatherly affectiō which he beareth to his, which as a father, he assureth them of, faile, although for a while he chastise thē. Wherevpon, the Prophet Habacuck calling the same to mind in his 3. Chap. saith, <hi>O Lord in thy furie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member yet thy mercy.</hi> The Prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not this as though the Lord were forgetful, but thereby to comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as after in the 23. verse we shall see, how Ieremy more at large, and in better tearmes setteth it downe, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that the mercies of the Lord are renued euery morning, to wit, daily, &amp; so long, as the day dawneth, &amp; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euery moneth, as the moone doth,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:176914:83"/> which the Hebrews tearme by a word that signifieth renewing, bicause she reneweth the moneths by her perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall course, as by her farre departing from the sunne, and her neere dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing vnto the same. But Ieremy spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the mercies of the Lord, goeth on further, and saith, to wit, that there is not one day that passeth ouer our heads, wherein we do not see new tokens of Gods mercies and fauour, according to that saying of the kinglie Prophet Dauid in his 30. Psalm. ver 5. <hi>Although</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that weeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the euening, yet ioy commeth in the morning.</hi> For this end and purpose, is greatly to be noted the saying of S. Cyprian in the fourth Epistle of his fourth booke of his Epistles, where he making mention of the afflictions that at those daies fell vppon the Church, saith: The Lord God (saith he) sheweth in the person of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants which he afflicteth, and whome he oftentimes taketh out of this world, a wonderfull renewing of his Church, as when after raine, he sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth faire weather, after darkenesse light, and after tempests, calmenesse.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:176914:83"/> reade, <hi>Thy truth.</hi> Some heere in this place take faithfulnesse for our faith or beleefe, and it is no small matter to beleeue in God: but yet heere, it soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth rather to be referred vnto the faithfulnesse of God, and the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his promises. For, the verie efficient cause of the renewing of the Church, and of the graces of the Lord, is his assured faithfulnesse, and constant veritie. For, God being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether true, and such a one as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hose goodnesse is not grounded vpon our deserts, it can not be, but that he must establish his Church, according to the free goodnesse, and the eternall and infallible truth of his promises, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing in vs a taste of his graces, which we find to be most pleasant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, after we haue for a time beene afflicted and beene depriued of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnesse. And therefore it was to great purpose, that the Prophet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy speaking of this faithfulnesse of the Lord, cried out and said, <hi>Great is thy faithfulnesse,</hi> putting vs in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous admiration of the fidelitie of this mightie God, who as S. Paule in the third Chapter of his Epistle to the Ephesians, verse 20. saith, <hi>is able to do
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:176914:84"/> exceeding abundantlie, aboue all that we aske or thinke.</hi> And so also writeth Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid in his 36. Psalme, verse 7. saying: <hi>How excellent is thy mercie O God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the children of men trust vnder the shadow of thy wings.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lord is good,)</hi> not onely good, but also louing, and liberall. But heere is to be noted, how Ieremy restraineth these promises which he sheweth vnto vs, when as he saith, <hi>That God is good vnto them that trust in him.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the louing kindnes of God be great, and his fidelity most sure, yet so long as the wicked and faithlesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine stil in their wickednes &amp; incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie, they shut vp the gate against the fauour of God, and neuer enioy this faithfulnesse, because God neuer promiseth in his word any such thing to such kind of people, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth his wrath &amp; mighty threats against thē, because, as in the 1. Tim. 2. Chap. it is written, <hi>his will is, that they which should be saued, should come to the knowledge of his truth,</hi> for all the elect of God are brought therevnto, in whom he worketh that which he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and giueth them new hearts to feare &amp; reuerence him. And aboue all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:176914:84"/> the rest, he would haue vs still trust in him, and neuer be weery in trusting to his goodnes, according to the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiō of the Prophet Abacuck in his 2. Chap. And therfore in the 78. Psal. the Iewes are sharply reproued for their impatiency, bicause they would limit the holy one of Israell, &amp; enforce him to do as pleased thē, &amp; help thē at such time &amp; in such sort as liked their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, as in the history of Iudith we reade the inhabitants of Bethulia did.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Wee commonly knowe, that there is a distinction and difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene moueable, and immoueable goodes, whiche are not so easilie
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:176914:85"/> to be carried away as mouable. Now, the Prophets call the Eternall, our right inheritance, firme, certaine, and immoueable prosperitie and welfare. For, when we haue said all we can, all the rest that we possesse are but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and fleeting possessions, euen vanitie it selfe, as by many examples we haue set downe, of whatsoeuer is vnder the sunne in the booke of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes, where in the twelfth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is concluded, <hi>That to feare God, and keepe his commaundements, is the totall and whole summe that is required in man.</hi> And therfore, when we reade in this place, or else-where, that God is called our portion and enheritance, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is to this end, that we should contemne, and make no reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fraile &amp; transitorie things of this world,<note place="margin">How gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the mightie and rich men of the world are deceiued in theyr false opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the faithfull seruants of God.</note> nor yet of these great mightie earthlie ones, who take all the faithfull that feare and obey God, to be but miserable wretched caitiffes, who for the more part haue scarsely one inch of ground, and yet for all that, they are richer then all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours in the world, who in the end are enforced to leaue all their arrayes, kingdomes, and whatsoeuer else, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:176914:85"/> be contented with three or four feete of earth, or as much as may burie a dead corps. Away therefore with all such vaine confidence, fye of all such enheritances, which so soone depart from vs, yea euen vnto those whome we neuer knew, nor yet will euer once thanke vs for them. Such I say, is the state and condition of all those, whose portion is heere in this world, and who feede themselues, as Dauid in his 17. Psalme, verse 14. saith, with these earthly delightes. But let vs hold this principle and ground which is written in the 73. Psalme, verse 1. <hi>That surely God is good vnto Israel, and to all those that reuerence him with pure hearts,</hi> so the same proceede from faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be for a time but poore with the goodes of this world: and that there is no such thing, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantlie to trust in God, who will let it be well knowne, as in the third Chapter of Malachy is sayde, <hi>That a man shall not lose his payne in seruing of him:</hi> and that although to the outward iudgement of man, there is great difference betweene the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and the children of this world, yet let them knowe, that

Now, this silence cōsisteth not only in not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring nor replying against God, but we must also take heed, that we in no case stubbornely and rashly depart frō our vocation, and quietly &amp; patiently walke in such sort as God hath called vs. For, Aristotle himselfe writeth, that it is the property of a wicked man to be always boiling, storming, and neuer resting and abiding all in one mind: so that a certain miserable and wretched man said once in Virgill, that if he could obtaine nothing at the hands of the Gods, that he would go down into hell, and see if he could obtaine any grace there.</p>

                        <hi>Who shall beare his yoke in his youth,)</hi> or from his youth: for no doubt of it, it is a maruellous matter for any man to accustome himself so frō his youth, &amp; frame himself vnto obedience. S. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary writing vpon the 119. Psal. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:176914:86"/> these words, <hi>Wherewith shal a young man redresse his way?</hi> sayth thus, the prophet Ieremy (saith he) in the 3. Chapter of his Lamentations, right well declareth, that it is the most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and most requisit thing for a yong man in his youth, to beare the yoke: for in very deede, custome doth and can do maruelous much. The Prophet therefore hath reason not to haue vs tarry vntill such time as we be either hardned, or waxe old and obstinate in our sinnes, against all discipline. True it is, that youth is verie impatient to beare the yoke, but after it hath once taken it, and accustomed it selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, it will then be quiet, and reioyce in the Lord: these men afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such valiant champions, and such notable practised souldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne and iniquitie, as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in this spirituall battell. The scripture commonly calleth wicked &amp; dissolute men, the children of Beliall,<note place="margin">VVhat the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Belial are.</note> that is to say, disordered mē, reiecting all rule &amp; gouernmēt. Now, there is no such way to bring thē to obedience, as to bow thē in time: neither is ther any age fitter, or soner framed to subiectiō, then youth, specially christian youth:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:176914:87"/> and when we are once accustomed to abide sorrow and paine, we are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a great deale the pacienter in all kindes of aduersities whatsoeuer, yea and we ioyfully receiue them: for, when we consider of that which is written in the 12. to the Hebrewes, <hi>That when God chastizeth vs, he offereth himselfe vnto vs as a father,</hi> chastizing vs for our good, that we might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his holinesse. To be short, Salomon in the 12. of his Prouerbes, verse 1. sayeth, <hi>He that loueth correction, loueth wisedome, but he that hateth disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, is a beast.</hi>

The like phrase of speech we shall reade in the 14. of the first to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes, verse 25. where it is saide, <hi>He will fall downe on his face and worship God, and say playnely, that God is in you in deede.</hi>

And yet this phrase and manner of speech proceedeth not of mistrust, but of a christian modestie, not prescribing vnto the Lord either the time, or yet the meane of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, and in acknowledging our vnworthines of his fauour, is alwayes spoken by way of submission, as in the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:176914:88"/> second of Ioel, vers. 14. is said, <hi>Who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth whether he will returne and repent, &amp;c.</hi> And likewise in the 8. of the Actes, verse 22. it is said vnto Symon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicien, <hi>Pray vnto God, that if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the wicked thought of thine hart may be forgiuen thee.</hi> S. Peter heere speaking of the mercy of God, was not in doubt thereof, but he said thus much to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to the end to humble him the more, and because he doubted of the soundnesse of his heart. For, as there is nothing more certaine and sure then the grace of God, euen so it is not for vs to define and determine when, and to whome he will communicate and bestowe his graces, seeing we are not sure of the faith of men. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, when as the promises of God are receiued by faith, they are certaine &amp; infallible: and this is most sure, that the Lord thrusteth not them backe frō him which come vnto him: and to be short,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> ther are none which beleue, shal perish, but shall haue euerlasting life.</p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Verse. </seg>30</label> him.)</hi> This also is a figuratiue kind of speech, named by the schoolemen <hi>Metonomia,</hi> when as the signe is taken for the thing signified. And so in this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:176914:88"/> place, <hi>to turne the cheeke,</hi> is taken to haue patience, and is asmuch as if Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy should haue said, he is so patient and curteous, as that, as a man would say, he turneth his cheeke to them that smite him. And therefore the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, because they knowe not, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this manner of speaking, do conclude according to the bare let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Sauiour Iesus Christ in the 5. of S. Mathew, <hi>That if we be striken vpon the one cheeke, we should turne the other.</hi> That he would make vs very idiots, to giue the wicked occasion to buffet vs on both cheekes, which were to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and maintaine euill, and mens outrageous liberty, and that were to tempt God, whose meaning is that we should auoide and withstand iniury &amp; wrong,<note place="margin">Iohn 18. verse 22.</note> euen as Christ Iesus himselfe did, who is the most perfect paterne, &amp; example of patience. For, whē one of the high Priests men stroke him on the cheeke, he turned not the other to him, but auoided the mischiefe, &amp; said, he was iniuriously dealt withal. We are therefore to obserue &amp; hold this rule, that when such commandements and aduertisements as these are, to wit, to turne our cheek to those that strike vs,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:176914:89"/> we must not thinke them to be spoken of our outward behauiour and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures: but we must vnderstand, that by these signes christian patience is greatly commended vnto vs,<note place="margin">VVhat the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our cheek to our enemy meaneth.</note> which ought alwaies be ready to beare new violēces, if it so please God, whē as we cannot otherwise by honest &amp; lawfull meanes auoid thē. Now, it is one thing patiētly to beare an iniury, &amp; another thing to oppose our selues vnto the iniuries &amp; violences of men, &amp; to giue thē occasion to no purpose, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason, despitefully to entreate vs.</p>

                        <hi>He forsaketh not for euer.)</hi> This is the third argument of comfort, which is drawne from the vse and end of our afflictions. Now, the miseries and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of this life which we can so hardly suffer and beare, commeth frō this, that we most oftentimes thinke that they will oppresse and cleerely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow vs, and that God hath vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsaken vs: howbeit, it neuer fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out so, neither is it yet his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and therefore there is no reason why we should be so impatient. The Prophet heere prooueth his saying by two reasons, the one, taken from the euent, and common experience, the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:176914:89"/> other, from the nature of God, and from his counsels. We are then heere in the first place to note, that the Lord neuer vseth to forsake those that are his, but rather vpholdeth them in the middest of their temptations, and with the temptation giueth a blessed and happie issue, as witnesseth vnto vs the holie Apostle Sainct Paule in the 10. of the 1. to the Corinths: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, besides our common experience, we haue the examples of Abraham,<note place="margin">God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no delight in the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any.</note> Ioseph, Dauid, Iob, and many others. Moreouer, this is most sure, that the nature of God is such, as that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth not in our afflictions, being himselfe naturally good, gentle, slowe to anger, and of great compassion. Thus we see how God is described vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs throughout the whole volume of the scripture, namely, in the 34. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Exodus, insomuch that when as Isaiah in his 28. Chapter, saith, <hi>He pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth and afflicteth vs,</hi> it seemeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he dealeth like a stranger, and not like himselfe. And namely, in the middest of all our afflictions, he maketh his singular goodnes alwayes appeere in the moderating of our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, turning them all to our
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:176914:90"/> benefite and welfare.<note place="margin">It is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and many times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the children of God, sometimes to suffer affliction, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie.</note> And according heereunto, most notably wrote Sainct Augustine in his Epistles to Felix and Rusticus, saying, what is it that our good God will not mercifully do vnto man? And how can it be, but that he will shew him all the fauour he can, considering that all the tribulations which he sendeth, are more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites. For, as prosperitie is a benefyte, and an effect of his comforts, euen so is aduersitie also a gift of God, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish vs, that we haue as great need of good admonitions, as we haue of consolations. And although God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Tyrants and wicked men to serue his turne for the punishing of vs, yet doth hee in no wise allow of theyr wickednesse, as Ieremy in the 34. 35. and 36. verses of this third Chapter most especially declareth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To subuert the right,)</hi> To do iniurie to prisoners. Such things, saith he, the Eternall seeth not, neither doth he allow of them, but rather dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth them. Some Interpretors haue read this a little otherwise, as Ieremy in the verses aboue mentioned, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfetteth the sayings of the wicked, who make themselues beleeue, that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:176914:90"/> the Lord seeth them not, when as they peruert iustice, and do wrong. According to which also, Dauid in the 94. Psalme speaketh of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: and such a one was that Tyrant of Sicile, who after he had sackt the Temples,<note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked when they scape punishmēt for doing of some notorious wicked deede, think that God likes of their villanous dealing, which is most blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous.</note> and was at Sea with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous winde, bragged, and swore most blasphemouslie, that the Gods fauoured and liked of Pyrates and Church-robbers: howbeit, it seemeth that the Interpretation which wee haue followed, stretcheth it selfe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and agreeth better with the meaning of Ieremy, to witte, that God taketh no pleasure in seeing of iniuries and extortions committed, neyther is he the author of them. And besides, he putteth not euill nor wicked thoughts into mens harts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, he ordeineth and guideth them to such ends as pleaseth him, repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing theyr boldnesse and malice when he himselfe thinketh it best.</p>
                     <p>And although in man his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there seemeth to bee great contrarietie in these sayings, that God alloweth not of wicked mens sinnes, and yet, that nothing is done without his commaundement
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:176914:91"/> and ordinance: yet shall we see a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table concordance and agreement betweene them, if so be we first of all looke into the great difference that is betwixt that which God created in man, and his naturall actions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his sinne, which is a blot and a leprosie in his nature.<note place="margin">God is not the author of sinne.</note> For, first, as concerning sinne, God neither allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth of it, nor yet commaundeth it: but, as appeereth by his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, both forbiddeth and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth it: and yet notwithstanding, he gouerneth his creature, and in him, and by him, all men mooue and liue. He limitteth also, and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally frameth and ordereth mens actions to such an end as best liketh him, whether it be for the chastising of those that are his, or for the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the world, which he by his woonderfull power and wisedome doth. Moreouer, it is verie needefull that we knowe after what sort God ordeineth and commaundeth a thing.<note place="margin">God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes.</note> For, one while he commaundeth, when he teacheth vs in his word, from whence he would haue vs learne his will, and what it is that we must do, or what it is that we must leaue

                     <p>Another while hee commaundeth that which hee gouerneth, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and guideth to such an ende as he himselfe lusteth: for in the 34. of Ieremie, it is there saide, that <hi>He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded famine, the sworde, the pestilence, and the Chaldeans to sacke Ierusalem:</hi> and yet the wicked knowe not, nor thinke any thing lesse then to obey him: and therefore are they punished and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>From the mouth of the most high, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Verse. </seg>38</label> both euill and good)</hi> here we haue great neede to beware, how we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande this manner of saying, to the ende wee may keepe vs from such as haue made God the Author of sinne, as did the Valentinians, the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, &amp; other Heretikes, who taught, that God created both sinne and euil, which is a most blasphemous, perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and insupportable doctrine, which thinge, Plato himselfe, in his bookes which he wrote of the lawes testifieth, And Homere likewise, who in the first booke of his Odes, bringeth in his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter speaking, sayth thus, That it is a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:176914:92"/> straunge and foolish custome in men, to attribute vnto God the euill which they thēselues do and procure. Howe much more should Christians then be far off frō any such thoughts, &amp; detest and abhorre such as sclaunder the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, in casting and laying vpō him all the sinne &amp; iniquitie that is in thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues? Nowe, when wee heare the mouth of the Lorde spoken of, in such places, we must take it for his decree and ordinaunce, and so is it taken in the 8. Chapter of Deutro. and allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged also in the fourth of S. Matthewe. <hi>That man liueth not onely by breade: but by euerie worde which proceedeth from the mouth of the Lorde:</hi> That is to saye, by his commaundement, ordinaunce, grace, and power: So also is it saide in the 25. chapter of Ieremie, <hi>That he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the sworde vppon all the inhabitantes of the lande,</hi> in which place, his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that he is determined to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the iniquitie of men, and that swords, and all other things else serue him, when as hee will execute his iust iudgementes. Nowe, we haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that what soeuer God ordeyneth, is iustly ordeyned: but yet it is in his onely woorde, that wee must learne
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:176914:92"/> what to doe, or what to leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and that hee commaundeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, what so euer happeneth in the worlde, not by way of instructing or counselling the same, but by waye of ordeyning or determining it vnto a certaine and good ende, as well the malice, as the wicked counsell of men: and heere among other thinges wee must see howe these woordes, that are written in the 16. Chapter of the seconde of Samuell, are to be vnderstoode, where GOD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth Semei to curse Dauid, not that the Lord gaue him commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doe it: But insomuch as the Almightie by his sure &amp; certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, directed &amp; addressed Semei his curses to another end then Semei his meaning was: to witte, to humble Dauid. Now this doctrin stayneth not God with any blot: but rather giueth him the commendation of the most highe, in that, as Dauid in his 115. Psalme. ver. 3. sayth, <hi>He doth whatsoeuer he will both in heauen and in earth.</hi> This doctrine also maketh vs patient in all our aduersities, and causeth vs submit our selues vnto his wil and ordinance: it stirreth vs vp also to call vpon him,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:176914:93"/> and to hange wholely vpon his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,<note place="margin">God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer created sinne in man, but ordereth and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the same which came of him selfe, through his fall, to such righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ends as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his holy and eternall counsell hath ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> as vpon him who by an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, power, wisedome, and goodnes, guideth all euentes and all things else whatsoeuer. And as for the euill of the fault, to wit, of sinne, It is not GOD that maketh it, but ordereth and disposeth the same to such righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endes, as he himselfe in his sacred and eternall counsell hath ordeyned. And for the euill of the punishment, to wit, of the aduersities, it is he that sendeth, willeth, and alloweth them, not so much by reason they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, and did exceede, or that the wicked so gently greeue and harme vs (for this our good God, hath no pleasure in our miseries) but because it is the execution of his iustice, and by reason also that they are whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some remedies, although bitter and sharpe ones, to awake our slouthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to whette our fayth and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. That place of the third of the Prophet Amos, where it is sayde, <hi>Js there any euill in the Citie which the Lorde hath not done?</hi> Must altogether be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode of the euill of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of the calamities, according as the circumstaunce of the mattet,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:176914:93"/> which the Prophet heere handleth, doth permitte: So that this Hebrewe worde <hi>Raah,</hi> is not alwayes taken in the scripture, for the euill of sinne: but also for the euill of affliction, as in the 15. of the Prouerbes, ver. 15. it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, where it is sayde: <hi>All the dayes of the afflicted are euill.</hi> And in the 45. of Isaiah, it is saide: <hi>Jt is the Lord that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth peace, and createth euill:</hi> where, is well to be seene, That the worde <hi>euill,</hi> is taken for that that is contrarie to peace and prosperitie.</p>
                     <p>And therefore seeing that all things are doone and gouerned by God his prouidence and appointment: It were an vnneedefull thinge to bring into the Church the doctrine of fortune or chaunce, which for the more part is borrowed of Aristotle and Tully, and grounded vpon an euil and false prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as though free will were such a thing, as that something might fall out or come to passe against the will of the Lord, if we should not restraine the same vnto our selues, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of vs, certaine vnlooked for thinges and euentes, which we see not the causes of, might come vnto vs by fortune or chaunce. Notwithstanding
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:176914:94"/> this is certain, that although the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which goe before, seeme to vs to come by fortune or chaunce, yet the eternall gouerneth them not by a chaungeable will (for there is no chaunge or ranging will in God) but by an immutable &amp; an eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, which ruleth aboue nature, and although nature fayle in her actions, yet he neuer fayleth in his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for example, by nature the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the dead, is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but it is because God hath so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, which cannot be stopped. Now then, although nothing be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods prouidence: yet can not man excuse himselfe when he sinneth, because he looketh not vnto God whē he sinneth, but sinneth without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straynt, freely, and of his owne accord. Secondly, because he hath the will of the Lorde declared vnto him in his woorde, according to which his life must be squared and ruled, and seeth as much in the worde, as he seeth in the punishing of the wicked, howe greatly sinne displeaseth the Lord.</p>

                     <head>THE DOCTRINES THAT are gathered from these verses.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are almost as manie notable doctrines in this part, as there are verses: but the principall doctrine concerneth the prouidence of God: the remembraunce whereof comforteth the Prophet Ieremie and the people in their greatest distresses. Nowe the <hi>Prouidence</hi> of God, as appeareth in the 37.<note place="margin">VVhat the prouidence of God is.</note> and 38. verses, is no naked and bare foreknowledge: or permission, or contemplation: but a continuall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and administration of all thinges, addressed to a certaine good end, which our God, by a sure, eternall, and holy counsell doth, in working all thinges by his firme and stayed will: and by him, all thinges consist and worke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: and as Ieremie here in our text sayth:<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. Colloss. 1. Iohn. 5.</note>
                        <hi>All thinges proceede from his mouth,</hi> That is to say, come from his ordinance, as heretofore hath been saide. They then are deceiued, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil not acknowledg a prouidence in God: as all Epicures: or else faine vnto them selues an vniuersall and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:176914:95"/> confused prouidence only: For the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scripture sufficiently telleth vs, that there is not so small and vile a thing, which the prouidence of God gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, and turneth to such an ende, as pleaseth himselfe, and therefore hee alone is commended to be Almightie: doing whatsoeuer he will, both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and in earth: and who gouerneth not onely the whole generall thing: but also all the meanes and instrumentes: which cannot doe, or execute any thing without his leaue, and ordinance. As for example, when as God had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that the seede of Abrahā should serue in Epygt, and that such a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage was pursued with a memorable deliueraunce. I beseech you tell mee, after what sort brought this great god this matter to passe: and how followed and performed he this worke? He sent dreames to Ioseph. He is solde to the Ismaelites: cast into prison: and from thence exalted to verie great honours: Long after that, was Moses borne: hee was miraculously preserued, and brought vp in king Pharao his house: and a great many of other wonderfull thinges came to passe, before such time as the people came out of Egypt, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:176914:96"/> so might we also bring foorth many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mo like examples.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude, let vs keepe in minde,<note place="margin">The vse of the doctrin of God his prouidence</note> that the vse of the doctrine of Gods prouidence is this: First of all it maketh vs a great deale the better vnderstande the excellent power of the eternall: who hath not onely cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the worlde, but also ruleth and gouerneth it: shewing and declaring no lesse his power in the gouernment, than in the creation of the whole. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this doctrine stirreth vs vppe, to pray earnestly vnto God, and inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauntly to recommend our selues vnto him, who hath all in his hande and conduct. Thirdly, it driueth vs vnto patience, and to abide and take all in good worth, whatsoeuer that this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together good and mightie God sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: as wee are taught to pray. <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> Last of all, it induceth vs, most reuerently to vse the seconde causes and meanes which God offreth vnto vs, when as we beleeue, that we haue them from the hande of the Lord: but yet so, as that wee, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, trust not, nor rest not to and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon those meanes: considering, that we are alwaies to haue a regarde vnto the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:176914:96"/> first cause, to wit, vnto that great and Almightie Creator, and Gouernour of the whole worlde. Neither is this doctrine common, with that foolishe destinie of the senselesse Stoikes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them, <hi>FATVM.</hi> For, the power and wisedome of God, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning the world, is another manner of thing, ouer and besides that coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of causes necessarily twixt ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof the Stoikes forge their destinie, neuer looking vnto God.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:176914:98"/> to that of S. Iames, saying: <hi>Jf any man among you be afflicted, let him pray.</hi> Now this is a verie good way to prepare vs to prayer, when as wee diligently trie and examine our selues: because God liketh of an humble and contrite heart. But it is a verie rare thinge to see anie of vs all take the paines to acknowledge our faultes: And S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine in the 11. Epistle of his thirde booke of his Epistles writeth thus: It is a rare thing (sayth hee) to see in vs, a true confession of our sinnes: for our nature will in no wise take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof: and manie times a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fonde kinde of shamefastnesse stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs from the same. To be short, wee had a great deale rather flatter our selues in them. And therefore is Ieremie thus instaunt, to haue vs searche and trie our wayes. For, our wicked wayes, as Ieremie in his fourth Chapter writeth, are the cause of our miseries. Howebeit wee must on the other side, of necessitie, ioyne fayth with the tryall that wee make of our selues and of our wayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may assure our selues to bee in Gods fauour: as Ieremie in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these wordes afterwardes, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Psalme, ver. 3.4. <hi>Jf thou O Lord</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>shalt looke straitly vnto our sinnes, who is able to abide it? But with thee is mercie, that thou mightest be reuerenced and feared.</hi>

The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid in his Psalmes, manie times vsed such a kinde of argument, and such a like reason, and among the rest in his 85.

                     <p>Nowe, it is sayde in our text, That God draweth neare vnto vs, so as we may feele him: because it seemeth he

Although in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deede, he is then nearest vs, when as he seemeth to bee fardest off from vs: and is alwayes neare vnto them, who truely call vppon him: as in the 145. Psalme, ver. 18. it is sayde. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, God biddeth vs not feare, not onely when wee shall see visions, as sometimes when the Angell, as it is written in the 27. of the Actes, ver. 24. appeared vnto Paule and sayde, <hi>feare not Paule:</hi> or as wee reade in the 25. chapter of the first booke of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Theodoret; howe that two men appeared in white vestmentes vnto the Emperor Theodosius in a dreame, when as hee was greatly tormented, who badde him bee of good cheare: but wee are to note, that the Lorde also assureth, and emboldeneth vs, in his word and sweete promisses: and likewise by his holy spirit: who ioyeth and delighteth our heartes, testifying vnto vs, that wee are the children of God. As in the 41. of Isaiah it is saide, <hi>J am the Lorde which tooke thee by the handt, saying, feare not, it is J that will

It seemeth here then that the Prophet requireth that an heape of curses might be layde vppon the heartes of his enemies, so as they might bee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered eyther with darkenesse, or with anguishes, or else with hardnesse of heart: as was Pharao, and all those whose hearts were fatted vp, as in the 6. of Isaiah we reade: so that that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought so to passe, they might fall out of one mischiefe into an other.

                  <hi>The fourth Chapter.</hi> The Argument of the Chapter.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter followeth, as it were, in his verses, the same order of the Hebrewe Alphabet, as the first Chapter doth: and although some ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vpon the words set downe in the 20. verse, <hi>of the king taken in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies nettes,</hi> meaning to referre this Chapter to the dayes of the death of king Iosias: yet because the history no whit agreeth with that which is heere spoken, we will be of their opinion that suppose and take, that in this Chapter is pursued, the selfe and same matter which is in the Chapters go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before: and that it is altogether a Lamentation, which the Prophet greatly desireth to engraue in the harts of all men, concerning the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of Babylon, and that which in those dayes fell out among the Iewes. For, Ieremy vseth no superfluous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, neither doth he lightly and as it were after a sclender sort, lament the miseries that then were, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:176914:106"/> deepe and holy sighes and groanes, proceeding from an heart, enlightened, guided, and gouerned by Gods owne spirit, who furnished, and deliuered vnto him by word of mouth those complaints that he might touch to the quicke, all such as commonly shew themselues too too blockish and drowsie.</p>
               <p>And in very deede, if we would but a little acknowledge our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, we should finde that wee are by nature very dull and sluggish, being nothing touched at the heart with the threats of Gods heauy wrath and indignation, so that we can not be too much spurred forward. For, there is no kind of matter or substance so easily to be set on fire, and therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to apt and disposed, that of it selfe will burne, if a man put not fire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: much lesse will man, who in heauenly things is farre colder then yse, become feruent and hoate, that is to say, be touched to the quicke, to vnderstand the iudgements of God, if he meete not with the fire of Gods word, and with some good and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous preachers of the same, and of the iudgements of the Lord. Now,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:176914:106"/> it is not for any man to say, with what diuersitie of art these Chapters of the Lamentations of Ieremy are made and colored, and of what weight and importance the similitudes and comparisons which he bringeth in, are both for the awaking of the veriest dullards, as also for the brideling and mouing to compassion the most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage and brutish persons.</p>
               <p>This foutth Chapter standeth vpon three partes: the first, beginneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh by way of exclamation, <hi>How, &amp;c.</hi> In which are conteined forcible la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations vnto the 11. verse. The amplifications of these Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are drawne partly from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and dignitie of those that were desolate, and comfortles prisoners, partly from the Nobilitie, Priestes, Nazarites, and yong children: some making great mone by reason of the great dignitie from whence they were fallen: and other some, because of theyr age: partly, by that that Ieremy compareth that people vnto certaine cruell and sauage beasts, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth also their ignominie vnto the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie of Sodome and Gomorre: partly, the Prophet taketh occasion to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:176914:107"/> amplifie the miserie that then was, by the sorowfull euents that at that time fell out: in that there was nothing else there to be seene, but lamentable and monstrous sightes, nothing but most infamous, miserable, and extreame dealings, euē to the seeing of vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mothers eating their own childrē.</p>
               <p>The second part, is the aunswere to this demaund, exclamation, &amp; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiō that is made in the beginning of the Chapter, and goeth on to the 20. verse. And in this part are partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, partly reprehēsions: for he there techeth, that these miseries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed frō the very wrath of God, but yet from a rightuous God, who, as in the 6. of the booke of Wisedome it is said, greeuously punisheth greeuous sins: shewing himselfe thereby to be a true God, in effecting that which he had threatned vnto men, and therefore it is past time, as in common prouerbe we say, to shut the stable dore when the steed is stolne, and to remember our selues, when vengeance is fallen vpon our heads. But it is our best to acknowledge our faults in time, whiles God speaketh vnto vs, and calleth vs to repentance. Howbeit, fooles, as we
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:176914:107"/> commonly say, are neuer wise vntill they are beaten, and neuer beleeue what is said vnto them, vntill it lye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their iacks.</p>
               <p>After these instructions of Ieremy, he addeth also certaine demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reprouing the cruelty of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, in the 13. verse: reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the exceeding dissolutenes of the people in the 14. and 15. verses: and in the 17. and 20. verses, he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fault with mens vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the arme of flesh and bloud.</p>
               <p>The third part of this Chapter is a prophesie, wherein is foretold the iudgements of God against the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, namely, against the Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means, who shewed themselues more outrageous, then all the rest of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as also may be seene in the prophesie of Obediah.</p>
               <p>Thus we see, how, after that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked haue braued themselues, and at their pleasures raunged abroade, that they themselues also shall haue their turne and course, and be called to a reckoning, and it is they that shall drinke the lees and dregs of the Lords cup, although his iudgements begin first at his owne house. Now this is a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:176914:108"/> very profitable doctrine for vs: for, as Sainct Ambrose in his Offices sayth: There is nothing that bringeth a man sooner to an honest course of life, then when he setteth before his eyes, that God will iudge the world: yea euen that great God, from whose eyes nothing is hid nor couered, and who alloweth of nothing, but of that which is good and honest, detesting all beastlinesse and villany. This consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods iudgements ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs patiently beare our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the insolencies of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, according to that saying of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid in his 119. Psalme, verse 51. 52. <hi>The wicked O Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>haue made an exceeding skorne of me: yet haue J not declined from thy lawe. J haue cald to mind thy iudgements which thou hast done of old, and haue by them beene comforted.</hi>

This fine gold in the scripture is called the gold of Vphaz, or of Ophir, as in the 45. Psalme, verse 10.14. By this comparison of fine gold and fine sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the scripture representeth vnto vs most excellent and perfect things. In the first Chapter of Isaiah, the Lord maketh this complaint, saying: <hi>Thy siluer</hi> (saith he) <hi>is turned into drosse: And thy wine is mingled with water:</hi> meaning heereby, that the most notable men among the people were degenerate.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:176914:109"/> Now Ieremy expoundeth it himselfe, when as he nameth the noble men of Syon, and compareth them vnto fine gold: for the more honorable that we haue sene a man placed in high roome and dignity aboue other, so much the more straunge it is vnto vs, when we see the same man abased and brought lowe. It is euen as fearefull a sight, as to see the Eclipses of the Sunne and the Moone, or as Iob in the 24. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his booke, verse 24. saith, <hi>As if a man should cut off in sommer the top of an eare of corne: or, as if a man should see a Crowne of fine gold troden vnder feete.</hi> And as we reade also in the 28. of Isaiah, verse 23. where this great God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the king of Israell, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Ephraim by his Prophet, saith thus: <hi>Because,</hi> saith he, <hi>of your pride and dronkennes, your crowne of pride shall be broken and troade vnder feete, and all the flower and beawty of your magnificence shal fall to the ground.</hi> Thus we see, that the Prophet Ieremy doth not only lament that which generally hapned vnto all the people, but setteth downe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular what hapned to all estates, as well to the mightie ones, as also to the baser sort, giuing to the great and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:176914:110"/> noble men of this world,<note place="margin">Two aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisements vnto the mightie ones of this vvorlde.</note> two notable aduertisements: first, that they ought to be more excellent and vertuous in life and conuersation, then others, and therein surpasse all the rest, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that true nobilitie should so farre surmount the common people, as fyne gold surmounteth all other mettalles. Secondly, he maketh the mighty ones of the world vnderstand, that they are as subiect to falling and affliction, as are the most poore and miserable: and that for them to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based, is to themselues so much the more intollerable, bicause they had beene once exalted vnto high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And this commeth to passe, when as we feare not him that is Lord ouer all, and whose throne is exalted aboue the heauens: by reason whereof, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid in his 29. Psalme, verse 5.6.7.8.9.10. exhorteth all Princes <hi>to giue glorie vnto this great Lord, who with the onely noyse of his thundering voyce, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the whole world tremble.</hi> They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that regard not this great Ruler, before whome, all the mightie Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the world are but dust and ashes, do wonder to see how the most honorable personages, and men of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:176914:110"/> note, should decline or fall: euen as Titus Liuius in the 9. Booke of his 4. Decade, wondred how these three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and lusty men could come to so lamentable an end, and so farre disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing frō their former high estates, to wit, Anniball, who being betrayed by his hoste, was poisoned, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Scipio, who died in exile.</p>
                     <p>Now, Ieremy describeth vnto vs these mightie and noble men, not onely by these comparisons of golde and siluer, but also by the fashions of their fine and straunge kinds of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, according to that which Iesus Christ in the 11. of Sainct Matthew, setteth downe, saying: <hi>They</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that weare fine and costly apparell, are, for the most part in kings houses:</hi> and it was spoken to this end, that such lustie gallants should wisely learne to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that they haue a great Lord in heauen, who can easily pull from them their ornaments and costly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and cloath them with sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and ashes, as in the third of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiah, verse 24. he threatneth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>That in stead of sweete sauours, he will send them stench, in stead of a girdle, a rent, and in stead of braue fashions of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:176914:111"/> apparrell and curling the haire, sackcloth and baldnesse, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore, let all the mighty ones in the world vse their braue and costly apparell modestlie, and without pride, alwaies acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that all the cost that is besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed heere in this world, is but euen as smoke.</p>

The Hebrewe word <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin,</hi> which is translated, Dragons, is taken for earthlie Serpents, and sea monsters, that creepe on the earth. Some thinke, that in this place hee meaneth the sea calues, of whome, Plinie writing in the 13. Chapter of the ninth booke of his historie, sayth, that when they come neere the shore, they giue their young ones sucke, and lay them in some warme drie place, vntill such time as they haue by little and little wonted them to the water.

Chapter of his 4. Booke vpon that part thereof, wherein he treateth of liuing creatures. Some reade thus, like vnto the Owles, who as they say, forsake their yong ones. It should seeme that this place of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy hath a kind of reference vnto that which is written in the 39. of Iob, verse 19. where it is said, <hi>That the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strich is as cruell vnto her young ones, as though they were none of her owne, &amp;c.</hi>

And although they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained from wine, and many other pleasant things, yet Ieremy in this place testifyeth, that they had lustie bodies, and well colored faces: as in the first of Daniell we reade, how that he and his companions through the same prouidence of the Lord, were in as good case and better with their pulse, then they which did eate the most delicate meates that came from the Kings table. Howbeit, this order now of the Nazarites hath an end in the new Testament: as also the order of the Leuites, euer sithence the great and excellent priest Iesus Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered: who, although he was not by profession a Nazarite (for he did eate and drinke as other men did) yet is he a right Netzer, that is to say, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of the house of Dauid, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be lost: and being a dweller in Nazareth, would haue it, as it were by the allusion of the word, to be made so knowne. And as for Christians,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:176914:113"/> they should be alwayes right Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, seperating themselues from all vncleannesse, as in the sixt of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the Corinths it is written.

Nowe, the Prophet bringeth in heere two occasions: The one is the sinne of the people, as heretofore wee haue seene in the 8. verse of the 1. Chapter: The other is the wrath of God &amp; his iust iudgements, according to which he punished the sundrie sins which raigned in this people.

                        <hi>The kings of the earth would neuer haue beleeued,)</hi> As if he would haue saide, This is a verie straunge calamitie, and such a one as that the most barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tyrauntes durst not once haue thought that euer such miseries shold haue ouer taken vs. For when God fauoured vs, it was a pleasure to see
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:176914:115"/> these people, whome all the kings in the world feared, as in the 48. Psalme we reade, where it is said, <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the Citie of our God, euen vppon his holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Mount Syon lying Northward, is faire in scituation, it is the ioy of the whole land, and the Citie of the great King. Jn the palaces thereof God is knowne for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge: for loe, the Kings were gathered, and went together. When they sawe it, they maruelled, and were astonied, and suddenly driuen backe. Feare came there vpon them, and sorrowe, as vpon a woman in trauell, &amp;c.</hi> But now, sayeth Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it appeereth how all things are turned and changed, considering that they which heeretofore were astonied to see our greatnesse and prosperitie, are at this present abas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to see our aduersitie and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And in the meane while it fel vpon them euen as the Lord had said in the 28. of Deuteronomy, to witte, <hi>That if they would diligently hearken vnto the voyce of the Lorde theyr God, that they should be blessed with all kindes of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singes, and that all the people of the world should acknowledge, that the name of the Lord should be called vpon ouer them, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:176914:115"/> that they should be afraide of them. But that if they woulde not obey him, that the Lorde would bring them and their King vnto an vnknowen Nation: in the middest of which they should serue straunge Gods, and be a by-worde and prouerbe among all people, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Whiles I am a writing of these things, I cannot without great griefe and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe of heart, but call to minde the great number and well peopled Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which I remember I haue seene in the principall Cities of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of Fraunce, sithence the yeare 1560. vntill the yeare, 1570. which in the prime yeares, did so agree, &amp; were so zealous, and were so honored and feared, as that the enimies themselues neuer thought that it had beene possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to haue become so, as it were in a moment, ouerthrowen and destroyed: such was the accord, courage &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie, namely of a good part of the nobilitie of France. And although the destruction was sudden, straunge, incredible, yea and such as that verie hardly might or could the Churches bee raysed vp againe, yet for all that, the faithfull should neuer bee discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, nor helpelesse: For the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:176914:116"/> of Churches is not so straung, as the deliuerāce is wonderful, &amp; worthy the noting: which thing is notably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented vnto vs in the 126. Psalm. in these wordes following, saying: <hi>When the Lorde brought againe the captiuitie of Syon, we were like thē that dream. Thē was our mouth filled with laughter, &amp; our tongs with ioy, then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.</hi> And in the 49. of Isaiah it is there said: <hi>Thus saith the Lord, the redeemer of Israel, to the despised soule, to a Nation that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred: to the seruauntes of Rulers: Kings shal see &amp; arise, and Princes shall worship, because of the Lorde that is faithfull, and for the loue of the holy one of Jsrael which hath chosen thee.</hi>

                        <hi>Because of the sins of her Prophets)</hi> now the Prophet beginneth particularly to set down the cause of their desolatiō: not acknowledging only, as it were by the way, the sins of the people, but also aggrauateth and greeuously accuseth thē in particularities. For hee cōplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and telleth them that their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes did so exceede, as that they all erred and became degenerate: yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen they, on whō the world had a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular opinion of holines &amp; integritie.</p>

                     <p>Now, this is a miserable estate, &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way to be lamented, when as the Magistrates &amp; Doctors of the church, who should shew the way, and a liuely lawe vnto others, shall shamelesly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file thēselues, &amp; wallow in al maner of pollutions. For, our Sauiour Christ, as in the 5. of S. Matt. it is writtē, speking to his disciples, &amp; to the doctors of the Church, saith thus vnto thē: <hi>ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt loose his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to what vse is it good? It is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but to be cast out of the dores, &amp; trāpled vnder foote.</hi> In the 4. &amp; 5. of Ose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah also a great cōplaint is made of the sinnes of the Priests and Magistrates, because <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                        </hi> they who should throughly haue administred equitie and iustice, laye in waite for the life of others: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as foulers laye their nettes for birdes. This then is an heape of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">A most sure signe and token of a destruction at hand vp on any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not to be avoided.</note> and a sure token of a destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at hande, and not to be auoyded, whē as they that should be the master Masons, do thēselues destroy &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Church: &amp; they which with good &amp; holesome doctrine &amp; example shold teach the world, shew thēselues to haue in them, neyther soundnesse of doctrine, nor yet holinesse of life.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:176914:117"/> And this (alas) is too too common a thing, That by how much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent giftes, men are endewed withall, and as it were the lights of the world, euen by so much the more, are their faultes the greater, and do more hurt, and are the more straungly eclipsed when as they goe astraye: yea and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come farre more cruell and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: As among other examples wee may see in the 26. of Ieremie, howe that the furie of the false Prophetes was more barbarous, and more vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable against him, thē was the rage of the King, or of the people; which thing we haue long sithence by wofull experience found. And therefore the meaning of Ieremie in this our text, is this, that this people could not long continue in this case and quietnesse, where such dissolutenesse of life was, and where the will and affection of the Magistrates and Priestes stood for lawe: whose handes also were all full of bloud: whereupon may soone bee coniectured, that the state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the common people was verie euill and too too vile, when as the most notable personages, and such as should haue shewed good examples
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:176914:117"/> to others, had so greatly forgotten themselues. But if there were anie of them that went somewhat farther, yet exceeded they their office and dutie, in that through a foolish and vaine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance they more looked for ayde out of Aegypt, and trusted more to the arme of flesh and bloud, than vnto the liuing God.</p>
                     <p>Of the estate and condition of these dayes, especially after the death of Manasses, we reade in the thirtie sixe Chapter ver. 14. of the second booke of the Chronicles that which ensueth: where it is saide: <hi>All the chiefe of the Priestes also, and of the people trespassed wrongfully, according to all the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Heathen, and polluted the house of the Lorde which he had sanctified in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. Therefore the Lorde God of their Fathers sent vnto them by his messengers, rysing earely and sending: for he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on his people, and on his habitation. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his wordes, and misused his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, vntill the wrath of the Lorde arose against his people, and till there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, &amp;c.</hi>

                        </hi> Apostles &amp; all true faithfull men were wont to do: to be short, ther is nothing among vs, but an insatiable desire of scraping together of this worldly pelf: insomuch that there is neither religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor yet deuotion in the ministers of the Church: neyther sounde fayth, nor mercie in works: nor discipline in our manners.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:176914:118"/> vsurie. Now when we shalbe such kind of men, what punishment can be too greeuous for vs to suffer? Namely, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that long ago, as appeareth by the 89. Psalm. That the Lord admonished his Church, <hi>That if his children propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his statutes, and contemned his lawes, that he would visite their sinnes with rods.</hi> Thus wee see what S. Cyprian hath sayde of his dayes. Heere then we see in summe, what haue beene the sins that haue caused the ouerthrowe of mightie peoples and nations, and haue beene sure forerunners of a very neare desolation,<note place="margin">The sinnes that are the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a kingdome.</note> when as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats &amp; gouernors of the People, shall suffer their affections runne at rouers, and bee bought and solde, drawing by their example all the rest of the people to an extreme licentiousnesse of wicked dooing. And although the ciuill lawes say, That the people ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer die, because ther are alwaies some others to succeede, yet is it a sorrowful death, to see a good policy or gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment die, and to cause a chaunge in the estate, which is the ruyne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all well ordered thinges.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:176914:119"/> of the construction and shortnesse of the Hebrewe tongue, which vseth not many words. The most Hebrewes vnderstande this according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to wit of the blinde: that they fell in the streetes through the multitude of dead bodies <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                        </hi> lay vpon the ground, &amp; therefore were polluted with bloud, for which cause, as many as mett with those blind mē, would crie out a farre of vnto them and say, depart ye pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, depart, depart, and touch vs not, least ye pollute vs, and it seemeth that the Zurich translation hath followed this interpretation. Howbeit the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of other Interpretors, whō we in this place followe, suppose that the Prophet calleth these wicked Priestes and false Prophets (of whom he heretofore spake) blind men, who being ouercome with crueltie &amp; rage, made quarrelles and seditions in the streetes, and imbrued themselues in bloud: whereuppon, it came to passe that the common people, or, some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thinke, certaine of the heathen, in way of mockerie, cryed out vppon them and saide, depart ye polluted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, depart: get you a good way from vs, hauing regarde vnto the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:176914:120"/> in the law, for the separating of the vncleane: as if it had been a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, which <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                        </hi> Lord had through his iust vengeaunce caused, these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Priests polluted with bloud, to be dispersed, &amp; driuen farre away from the sanctuarie: banishing thē this way and that: In so much, that the profane Nations scorned them, &amp; tooke them to be a profane and an abhominable people. Moreouer, when the Prophet sayth, <hi>They shall no more dwell there: or they shall returne no more thether to dwell:</hi> It was not to put the people out of hope of their returne: but speaketh it there only in regarde of those wicked ones, whome God punished for their crueltie: and speaketh also according to the outward shew of the things that then were: at which time all thinges were in a lamētable case, so that there was nothing there to bee seene but a very deepe dungeon of all miseries: In such sort as that whē the Prophet Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel in his 37. chap. meant to cōfort the people, &amp; assure thē of their return out of captiuitie, saith: <hi>That it should be like vnto the resurrection of the dead, euen as if drie bones should be clad with skinne, and a newe soule breathed thereinto.</hi> This
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:176914:120"/> place then is manifest &amp; cleare, if we consider the meaning of the Prophet, and the sequele of the verses, and the manner also of the vsuall speaking in the scriptures, which commonly call the blind, such as are blinded through couetousnes &amp; presumption: as in the 42. of Isaiah ver. 10. it is saide of the Iewes, in this maner:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note>
                        <hi>Who is blinde but my seruaunt?</hi> Iesus Christ also calleth the Scribes and Phariseis blinde, and leaders of the blind. Here also, for the vnderstanding of this place wee must call to mind, the ceremony comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the law: where euerie man was forbidden to touch anie dead thing, or bloud: such a wonderful mind had the Lord to estraunge his people from all kinde of crueltie: and aboue all other, the Priestes were enioyned holines: who were especially forbiddē to be at the buriall of the dead, and to come where any dead dody was: as in the 21. Chap. of Leuiticus we may read.

For, we haue in all ages seene amonge the verie Heathen Priestes, some shewe of wisedome and vertue, which made the people honor them, as we may reade in Plutarch his treatie vpon Isis and Osiris, where he writeth,<note place="margin">The Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians chose their kings eyther frō among the Priestes, or from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Souldiers.</note> That the kinges of Aegypt were chosen either out of the order of the Priestes, or else from among the souldiours, because the one was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and feared for their valure, and the other, for their wisedome: and therefore it is no maruell though the Prophet Ieremie bringeth in the very Heathen, scorning the profanes, shamelesnesse and infamie of the Priests and false Prophetes of Iudah.</p>

The like words we find in the 69. Psalme, ver. 3. where it is sayde: <hi>Mine eyes faile, while J waite for my God.</hi> That is to say, I haue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and without ceasing looked, and neuer cast mine eye aside. Nowe vpon this place we are to note the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, &amp; call to minde how the Iewes in verie deede oftentimes called for the helpe of the Aegyptians, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the same. True it is that wee read in the 37. Chapter of Ieremie, how that Pharao his armie marched out of Aegypt against the Chaldeans, whereupon the Citie of Ierusalem for a while had some rest, &amp; was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so straightly besieged:<note place="margin">A daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and set light the wrath of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> which thing made the false Prophetes waxe hautie &amp; proud, and band themselues against Ieremie, as though his threats of Gods wrath, and of the destruction of Ierusalem, had beene friuolous and nothing worth: as commonly fonde and foolish worldlinges are woont to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:176914:122"/> tryumph before the victorie. Howbeit it was the determined Counsell of God to punish this people: as in the Chapter aboue mentioned, ver. 8.9.10. is founde this threatning of the Lorde, saying: <hi>The Chaldeans shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and assault this Citie: and shall take it, and set it on fire. Deceaue not your harts, saying, the Chaldeans shall surely depart from vs: for they shall not depart. For though ye had smitten the whole hoste of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should euerie man rise vppe in his tent, and burne this Citie with fire, &amp;c.</hi> Wee reade also in the 24. Chapter of the 2. booke of the Kinges, howe that the power of the Babylonians was so great as that the Aegyptians were enforced presently to retire, and keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues at home in their own countrey. And yet notwithstanding it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing to see in what a wonder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full iolitie the Iewes were, of the aide of Aegypt, most slauishly gaping after it, and putting all their whole trust &amp; comforte therein: which made the Prophets manie times testifie against them, as in the 30. Chapter of Isaiah, it is sayde, <hi>Woe to the rebellious children</hi>
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:176914:122"/> (sayth the Lorde) <hi>which walke foorth to goe downe into Egypt (and haue not asked at my mouth) to strengthē themselues with the strength of Pharao, and trust in the shadowe of Egypt: but the strength of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao shall be your confusion, and the trust in the shadowe of Egypt, your confusion. For thus saith the Lorde your God, in quietnesse and in confidence shall bee your strength, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is wonderfull to see howe these wretched Iewes could neuer haue the mindes to looke for any helpe at the Aegyptians handes,<note place="margin">Plutarch in his treatise of Isis and Osyris.</note> considering that Plutarch himselfe, as heathenish as he was, testifieth, that the Aegyptians laughed to skorne the worshipping of creatures, and brute beastes, and that they neuer had such brutish &amp; beastly thoughtes: And as they were many in number, so also were they cōmonly a fickle and an vncertaine people: and therefore the eternall and almightie God had great reason to forbidde his people to haue any league and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar dealing with the Aegyptians: first, because <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                        </hi> Iewes had alreadie so much degenerated in Aegypt, as that they could not but sorrrow in that they had forsaken the Garlicke and Onyons of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:176914:123"/> the same Countrey, notwithstanding all the slauery which they there suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and were brought at last euen to be defiled with the cursed Idolatrie of Aegypt, as in the 20. of Ezechiel, ver. 7 we may reade. Secondly it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in so great an incompatibilitie of religion and manners, whereof wee also reade in the 45. of Genesis, that there could be any true and faithfull loue and amitie continued betweene them: considering the naturall and auncient hatred which the one of thē bare to the other: which thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, representeth vnto vs the hatred and malice which the diuell &amp; Antichrist beareth vnto the church of Christ, and the bondage of Aegypt vnder Pharao, with the bondage of sinne, which esclaueth vs vnto Sathā. Thirdly, the Lord right well sawe, that this trusting to the helpe of Aegypt, brought his people a sleepe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe them from hauing any hope in the conduct of the Almightie, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the God <hi>Schada,</hi> for so hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himselfe in the 17. of Genesis, when he spake vnto Abraham: that is to say, he that is all sufficient: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the Lorde also sayth in the 31.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:176914:123"/> of Isaiah, ver. 3. <hi>The Egyptians are men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirite; and when the Lord shall stretch out his hande, the helper shall fall, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therfore Dauid went more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely vnto worke, when as he saide in his 73. Psalme, ver. 25.27.28. <hi>Whom haue I in heauen but thee? Neither haue J in earth any other but thee. Thou destroyest all those which withdrawe themselues from thee:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">It is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous thing to be in league or haue any familiaritie with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note>
                        <hi>as for me it is good that J draw neare vnto God, &amp;c.</hi> They thē are at all times deceiued, and dayly deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that fall in league, and be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly acquainted with the children of this world, namely with Idolaters: who care not for the purchasing of the welfare and good of the Church, which to them, is a verie thorne in their foote: neither had God any such regarde, as to doe the Aegyptians the honor to make them the instruments for the deliueraunce of his Church. In so much as it is a lamentable thing, to see such a great number of Churches, after so many scorchings and fryinges so opinatiuely seeke after the deceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fellowship of Aegypt, &amp; the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginatiue power of the mightie ones, whose greatnesse consisteth more in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:176914:124"/> titles and opinion, then in effect or in deede: For, let them knowe this, and take it for a principle or ground, That God will in no wise deuide his honour with men: but will reserue this honour of the ayding and defending of his Church to himselfe alone: and shee also shall call vpon him, and worship him alone: as in the 43. of Isaiah, ver. 11. it is sayd: <hi>J, euen J am the Lord, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side me there is no Sauiour. I haue declared, and J haue saued, and J haue shewed, when there was no straunge God among you: and therefore you are my witnesses, sayth the Lorde, that J am God.</hi> And in the 23. of Ezechiell, ver. 27.28.30. our God is so angrie against these goers and commers into Aegypt, as that he saith after this manner: <hi>J will make thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse to cease from thee, and thy forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the lande of Egypt:</hi>

                        <hi>so that thou shalt not lift vp thine eyes vnto them, nor remember Egypt any more.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:176914:124"/> or not aide themselues therewith. But in the first place, the Lordes meaning is, that we should not vse any vnlawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or forbidden meanes to helpe our selues, or which might any way, were it neuer so small, withdrawe vs from his true seruice and worship. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, hee would not haue vs set our whole minde and affection vppon the meanes which hee giueth vs, nor yet trust altogether vnto thē: But depend vpon his onely prouidence: and make his helpe our buckler: considering that it is hee which rayseth vppe the meanes for vs: and he who without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worldely meanes, and against all hope, is able, and can defende vs:<note place="margin">2. of the kinges 19.

And in the yeare of our Lord 1453. the like issue as it were, had Constantine Paliologue, the last Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Constantinople, who flying away, was put to death, after that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet the seconde had besieged the said Citie, &amp; taken it by assault a little while after.

                        </hi> which fell vpon Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechias, was farre more lamentable: because that in his owne sight his own children, and the greatest part of the

And this was his punishment, first, for his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against God, and next, for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against the king of Babylon, vnto whom he had falsified his fayth: whereupon he was wrapped and foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in all kinde of miserie: For, no flying could saue him, nor any secret place hide him, when as God would haue him render an account. For, God is not bound to keepe promise, and be fauourable with, and to those, which will not keepe their faith, and be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, with, and to him: So that when God forbiddeth vs not to touch his anointed,<note place="margin">Psal. 105.</note> he meaneth that we should not touch those Princes, which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and acknowledge him for their soueraigne: otherwise it is meete that they execute their office: for God is no acceptor of persons, and they shall die as well as the rest, as Dauid in his 82.

                     <p>And in the 49. Psalme, he speaketh of kings that shall be fettered in yron chaynes. Now, the Prophet Ieremie,<note place="margin">A note worthy the obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> by the way, meaneth to reprehende and taxe the foolish confidence which the Iewes had in their king Zedechias, vnder whose shadowe they looked for nothing but peace and quietnesse. For although the Lorde in verie deede, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes cōmunicateth vnto vs great benefites by the handes of all kinges and Princes, as in the 4. Chapter of the first booke of the kinges we reade, that in the dayes of Salomon euerie man liued peaceably vnder his vine and figge tree, and that for that cause kinges are compared to great trees full of greene leaues, vnder which, manie liuing creatures shadow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:<note place="margin">Daniel. 4.</note> yet must wee put great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt good Princes, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and Apostate Princes, in which ranke Zedechias was one: and yet withall, very good Princes are subiect to alterations and chaunges, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man is a lyar, whereof wee haue a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:176914:127"/> notable example in the person of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon: and therefore the surest way for vs, is to beleeue that which Dauid setteth downe in 33. Psalme, ver. 12.16. where he sayth: <hi>Blessed is that nation whose God is the Lorde: The King is not saued by the multitude of an hoast:</hi> And in the 146. Psalme, ver. 3.4. he sayth: <hi>Put not you your trust in Princes, nor in the sonne of man, for there is no help in him His breath departeth, and he returneth to his earth, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The complaint of Ieremie, taken from the king of Iudah, putteth mee in remembraunce of such thinges as in our dayes haue come to passe about the Churches that professed the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which is, that the greatest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongst them, and of whom most account was made: as namely the two braue and stout Princes, Fredericke Duke of Saxon, &amp; Philip Landgraue Hesson fell into the enemies handes in the dayes of the Protestantes wars: as also of later date, but after a more cruell and barbarous manner, hath beene seene trapped, the vertuous men of note, my Lordes the Prince of Conde, and the Admirall Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, vnder whose two shadowes, the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:176914:127"/> worlde verily thought the Churches should safely and peaceably remaine: as in deede the Lorde had brought great things to passe by them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot, or at least will not, but make flesh &amp; bloud too too much our Arme: therefore the Lorde will haue such Princely nourish fathers to be taken from vs, to the end we should call vpon him, and say as Dauid in his 57.

The like reuolution also the Prophet Obadiah in the 16. and 17. verses of his prophesie, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde vnto the Idumeans, saying: <hi>As ye haue dronke vpon mine holy mountaine, so shall all the heathen drinke continually: yea they shall drinke and swallowe downe, and they shall bee as though they had not beene. But vpon mount Syon shall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce, &amp;c.</hi> To the same purpose al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so speaketh the Prophet Michah in his 7. Chapter, ver. 8.9.10. saying: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce not against me, O mine enemie: though I fall, I shall rise: when I shal sitte in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the Lorde shall be a light vnto mee. J will beare the wrath of the Lorde, because I haue sinned against him, vntill he plead my cause, and execute iudgement for mee: then will he bring mee foorth to the light, and J shall see his righteousnesse. Then she
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:176914:129"/> that is mine enemie, shall looke vppon it, and shame shall couer her which sayde vnto me, where is the Lorde thy God? Mine eyes shall beholde her: and see her trooden downe as the mire in the streetes, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreouer, we are to note this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner of speaking vsed in the holy Scripture, when as the Prophet sayth: <hi>That the cup shall passe vnto the Jdumeans:</hi> and as it is also sayde in the 75. Psalme ver. 8. <hi>That there is in the hande of the Lorde a cup, and the wine is red: and it is full mixt, and he powreth out of the same: surely all the wicked of the worlde shall wring out, and drinke the dregs thereof.</hi> Which saying is thus much to declare vnto vs, that like as the father of an housholde distributeth to euery one his portion and due, euen so doth our great God, appoint to euerie one his charge, punishment and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but yet to diuerse ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses: For, this drinke is to some, to wit, to the elect of God, an holesome medicine, as a draught of wine mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately taken is comfortable and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the heart of man. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as Dauid writeth in his 16. Psalm ver. 5. <hi>The Lorde is their portion and their cup, &amp;c.</hi> But it destroyeth the wicked,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:176914:129"/> euen as the dregges of wine which dronkardes drinke, destroyeth them. Such a cup of drinke was it that was giuen to the Idumeans, who should be discouered and layde bare, euen like drunkards: and as it fell out with poore Noah when hee was ouertaken with wine. Which thing the Prophet Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in the 49. chapter of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, ver. 10.11.12.<note place="margin">Gennes. 9.</note> hath more expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, saying: <hi>J haue discouered Esau, I haue vncouered his secretes: and be shall not bee able to hide himselfe: his seede is wasted, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and there shall be none to say: Leaue thy fatherlesse children, and I will preserue them aliue, and let thy widdowes trust in me: beholde, they whose iudgement was not to drinke of the cup, haue assuredly drunke, and art thou hee that shall escape free? Thou shalt not go free, but shalt sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drinke of it, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it may be asked, howe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, why these Idumeans are set before vs, as the greatest enemies of the Church: seeing they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the auncient fathers. For Esau, who was surnamed Edom, that is to say, Redde, because he solde his birthright of eldership for a messe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:176914:130"/> of redde potage, as in the 25. of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis we reade, was the sonne of Isaak, Iacobs brother. The reasons which hereon are to be noted, are these: first, the righteous and vnsearchable iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God: who hated Esau, and made his mountaines desolate, &amp; yet iustly, as in the 1. of Malachy we read. For, throughout all the scriptures may be seene an extreme pride, and a very reuolting in Esau, and in al his, who sequestred and withdrewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into the mount Seir, and there trusting to their fortresses, lay in wait to vexe and trouble their brethren, in euerie place where they were able, as in the prophesie of Obadiah: and in the 137. Psalme we may read. And the inhumanitie and cruelty of these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was so great, as that they denied passage vnto their poore bretheren which were comming out of Aegypt: notwithstanding that they most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly besought them, as in the 20. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Nombers may be seene: To bee short, this was but a mingle mangle in their religion, although they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised: for there was nothing in them, but pride in their manners and behauiours, and violence in their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:176914:130"/> actions. And without all doubt, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of Caine and Esau was but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and representation of the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Apostasie, and wickednesse of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist: who after hee had once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to disturbe Christian Religion, and had attayned to great authoritie and power: set vp himselfe more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly against all true and faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, then all the rest of the heathen, and barbarous Nations. But wee will not here deale about the iolly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable titles of the Church, or yet of the successors of Peter: For, the Pope is such a successor to Peter,<note place="margin">A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</note> in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all his dealings, as Esau and the Idumeans were Successors to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Neither must we be discouraged, or thinke that God will continually suffer and abide this his arrogant and shamelesse boldnesse: but let him bee assured that he shall also drinke of the cuppe with the Idumeans: and that this great Babylon shall come downe, which hath doone thus manie and so great wickednesse, and spilt so much Christian bloud: as in the 18. of the Apocalipse is foretolde.</p>

Nowe, Ieremie his meaning is not, That the iniquities should be so consumed, as that there should be no more account made of them, but that the punishmentes and chastisements of their iniquities were ended &amp; past. For, after that the 70. yeares were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Lordes anger was past, and it neuer fell out after that, that all the people were ledde captiue: vntill such time as for their not acknowledging the day of their visitation, &amp; for their despitefully contemning of the glad tydinges of grace, the Citie of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem was rased by Tytus and Vespasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and all their gouernement ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen and brought to naught.

Now the captiuitie that they then were in, seemed to them more rigorous than the destruction of Sodome: first, because it seemeth in very deede, to bee more gentle and tollerable, precisely to fall into the handes of God, than into the handes of men, euen as Dauid in the 24. of the 1. of Samuell said. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we alwaies thinke short punishmēts and aduersities more tollerable, then those that continue long: as in the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of Babylon, to beholde whiles Ierusalem was besieged, the starued young children die of hunger in the streetes: the horrible murders of the Babylonians, the nobilitie carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captiue like poore beasts: the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie destroied: to heare the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the barbarous people: To liue and not to haue the meanes to liue well, was a great deale more greeuous

In very deede as for that that remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the destruction of Sodome is set downe vnto vs in the scripture, as a notorious and fearefull iudgement of God against the reprobate: as in the 13. of Isaiah. ver. 19. wee read, where it is saide. <hi>That Babylon which is the glorie of kingdomes, shall be in the destruction of God, as Sodome and Gomorhe.</hi> And in the 34. of the saide Isaiah, ver. 9.10. when a greeuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was denounced to the Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means, it is said, <hi>That the riuers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of should bee turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the lande thereof should be burning pitch: it shall not be quenched night nor day, and the smoke thereof, shall go vp euer more.</hi> And in the 7. verse of S.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Chapter is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called: <hi>The praier of the Prophet Ieremie:</hi> for it carrieth not with it the like argument that the others do: but seemeth to be, as it were, a verie recapitulation of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations. The order of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet is not obserued in this Chapter, but beginneth &amp; endeth with a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: whereupon it is called, <hi>The prayer of Ieremie.</hi> For, although the Lord was fully resolued, as heretofore wee haue shewed, to accomplish his furie, and exercise his iust iudgementes vppon the captiued people into Babylon: yet for all that, on the other side, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Iewes were promised to be one day deliuered, as in the 29. of Ieremie ver. 10.12. we read in these very words: <hi>After seuentie yeares</hi> (sayth the Lorde) <hi>be accomplished at Babell: I will visite you, and performe my good promise towarde you, and cause you to returne vnto this place: Then shall yee crie vnto mee, and yee shall goe and pray vnto mee, and J will heare
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:176914:138"/> you, &amp;c.</hi> By these wordes Ieremie tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, not to be faint hearted, nor yet yeelde, no not vnto the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame greeuous, and intollerable tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and afflictions, but rather with an invincible assurance laye fast holde vppon this anker of fayth and hope, in the infallible promises of our God, which the Apostle in the 6. to the Hebrewes, verse 19. calleth, <hi>The sure and stedfast anker of the soule.</hi> Vpon this anker did good Kinge Ezechias lay fast hould, when as after hee had heard the wicked blasphemies of Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaketh, hee sent Ambassadours vnto Isaiah,<note place="margin">Isaiah. 57.4.</note>
                  <hi>praying him to lift vp his prayer vnto God, for the residue that were left:</hi> that is to say, to pray feruently and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. See also howe the Prophet Habacucke concludeth his prophesie with a prayer in his 3. Chapter. For, after he vnderstoode by an especiall reuelation, that many great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties should light vpon the people, hee presented himselfe both in his owne name, and in the name of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, before the diuine Maiestie, giuing to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e prayer, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which we haue in the 50. Psalme
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:176914:138"/> ver. 1. where it is sayde, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, and I will heare thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The teares &amp; praiers of the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all before God.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And it was also verie well sayde of S. Ambrose, That teares and prayers are the very true armour and weapons of the seruantes of God: yea, armour and weapons of great effect, and terrible to the wicked.</p>
               <p>Now, there are in this Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned three pointes. For, in the fiue first verses is comprised the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, abridging, and abating of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, not to the ende to make knowen vnto GOD a thing which he before knewe not: but by our humilitie, to drawe him to compassion, and make vs our selues vnderstande and feele our miseries. And to make the matter more lamentable, the Prophet like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the people to poore fatherlesse children and widdowes, which kinde of people are greatly to be pitied, and are recommended in the lawe, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any man to hurt them, as in the 16. and 24. of Deutron. we may read. Ieremie amplifieth this complaint, by the excellencie of the thinges which they had lost, as of their so honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble possessions which were deliuered vp vnto the Heathen: and of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:176914:139"/> pouertie, and how the people with the endaungering of their liues, must get their foode, and howe that hunger oftentimes causeth men take ill counsell and part, so that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pressed with hunger, were brought to submit themselues vnto the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Assyrians, for bread: In so much that in steed of abundance they suffred want, in steede of libertie, scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie: and that which was most gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, no age nor sexe was exempt, or spared.</p>
               <p>But here a question may be moued, whether Ieremie keepeth a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and right proceeding in his praier, yea or no, because that in his prayer and petition, hee beginneth first to craue worldly thinges. For it seemeth, that it agreeth not with that order, that ought to bee in prayer, whereof the auncient Doctor Basil in his book of solitarie life speaketh, saying: There is in prayer sayth he, two partes? The first, requireth the glorifying of God, with a true submission: The other, the petition which wee entende to make vnto God. And therefore when thou entendest to pray vnto god, thou must not at the first choppe, beginne with
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:176914:139"/> thy demaunde: for in so dooing,<note place="margin">After what maner vve ought to beginne to pray.</note> thou discouerest a dishonest kinde of rashe boldnesse, as though nothing else mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee to pray, but thy necessitie &amp; want. Wherefore, when thou meanest to pray, cast thy selfe, thy wife, thy children, yea and al the world besides, behinde thy backe: and then let thy heart ascende into heauen, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne thy prayer for his glorie, who created all things both in heauen and in earth. And after thou hast glorified God, his power, goodnesse, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie: and acknowledged thine owne wretchednesse, vnworthinesse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie, then craue at God his handes, that which thou hast to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, &amp;c. Thus wee see what Basil saith. And this right well agreeth, with that forme of prayer which Iesus Christ himself hath taught vs, making vs beginne with sanctifying, hallowing of his name. But here we are to note, that God regardeth not so much the order, and eloquence of wordes, as he doth the heart. In so much that Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie oftentimes in the chapters going before, highly cōmendeth the iustice of God, and testifieth the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the peoples sins. Lastly,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:176914:140"/> there is a difference betweene artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prayers which a man vpon some meditation before hande, maketh and powreth out, although they be verie large, and those prayers which S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine calleth rouing prayers, as it were,<note place="margin">Augustine to Probā.</note> shot out of a bow, which we sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and lightly powre out, euen as we finde our want.</p>
               <p>The other part of Ieremie his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is a sounde and free confession of sinnes, as in the sixt verse may be seen. Woe be vnto vs, because we haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And from that place and verse we drawe the interpretation of the 7. verse, where it is saide: <hi>Our fathers haue sinned, and are not: and wee haue borne ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> It seemeth by these words that the Prophet murmureth, as though they had wrongfully &amp; without cause, borne the paine and punishment due to their Fathers: but when we conferre and compare it with the saying of the 16. verse, it appeareth that Ieremie his meaning was nothing else, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is sayde in the 9. of Daniel his prophesie ver. 5. saying: <hi>We and our fathers haue sinned, &amp;c.</hi> Which thing also Ezechiel in the 18. chapter of his Prophesie ver. 2. makerh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:176914:140"/> of, saying: <hi>Our fathers haue eaten sower grapes, and the children teeth are set on edge:</hi> nowe this is not the Prophet his opinion, but the opinion of the Iewes: who tooke the wordes amisse: as afterwarde in the 20. verse is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for thus it is saide: <hi>That the soule that sinneth shall die: and that God layeth no punishment vpon any man, except he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> deserueth it:</hi> And therefore these words of Ieremie, <hi>Our fathers haue sinned, and are not,</hi> are spoken only by way of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the long continuance of the aduersities, from the fathers to the children: So that their auncestors that were dead, seemed to haue escaped farre better cheape, than they that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, who sawe so long a continuaunce of miseries. Howbeit in the 16. verse he acknowledgeth it to bee the iust vengeaunce of God. And therefore both the one and the other is true, that is to say, That the childe beareth the fathers iniquitie: for so much as the children also are sinners: and it is all one reason with the Lorde to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the childrē, as well as the fathers: againe, it is true that the children beare their fathers punishmentes, and doe continue from the fathers to the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:176914:141"/> sonne, yea many times vnto the third and fourth generation: but yet most iustly, when as the iniquities of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers descende vnto the children by inheritaunce, and that when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren followe the wicked steppes of their fathers, then many times the sinnes of their auncestors are heaped vpon them, without God of his meere fauour and grace meaneth to exempt some one or other. And therefore Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie his intent was nothing lesse thā to flatter, or excuse the people: whom he alwayes as sharpely reprooued as any Prophet could doe: as in verie deede, it is the office and dutie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, to make men liuely feele the greeuousnesse of their sinnes: as S. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome very notably hath written vpon this place of the twelfe of Ecclesiastes ver. 11. <hi>The wordes of the wise are like goades.</hi> These wordes (sayth he) are not spoken to flatter and smooth men in their sinnes,<note place="margin">Flatterers the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idiotes and fooles</note> but to pricke and awake them that they might be stirred vp to repentaunce. If wordes therefore be accompanied with flattery, a man may very well conclude, that they proceed not from a wise heart. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The third part of the chapter, from
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:176914:141"/> the 19. verse vnto the end, is a prayer, and petition full of holy deuotion, and an acknowledging of the greatnesse of our God; as in the 19. verse, is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the eternitie and stabilitie of the Lordes throne, which is opposed vnto the frayle and weake thrones of earthly Princes, and of the Temple of Ierusalē, that was set on fire &amp; burnt, and is as much as if Ieremie shoulde haue saide. Although, O Lorde our God, all the world should tremble and shake, and the Temple of Salomon become more ruinous than it is: yet thy glory, O thou most high, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth firme and sure, and thy domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lasteth for euer, &amp; thou art strong ynough to vphold and maintain those that are thine. All the force of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is in the 20. verse, where Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie sayth: <hi>Wherefore dost thou forget vs thine owne people for euer, &amp;c.</hi> For a Master of a housholde hath great care ouer his seruauntes, and maintayneth them: now, wee O Lorde are thine, and therefore we beseech thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende and vpholde vs. But it may bee that some man will say, why? Euerie Master is bound to do that, if he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whereunto Ieremie aunswereth;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:176914:142"/> that God, whose throne is euerlasting, is full of abilitie to doe it. Againe on the other side, if any man would saye, why? it is reason that euery mā should helpe his seruaunts. But these people were sinners, and were reuolted from the obedience of the Lorde. Now Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my referreth al this vnto the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, &amp; maketh his foundation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the saying of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mist in his 79. Psalme, <hi>We are the sheep of thy pasture:</hi> And in the 120. Psalme, the Prophet also concludeth in this manner, that by reason of the vnion which the faithfull haue with Christ, therfore as the throne of God is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, euen so also shal his seruantes remaine and his church be preserued.</p>
               <p>In the 21. verse followeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande, <hi>Conuert vs vnto thee O Lorde, and we shall be conuerted.</hi> Euen thus do Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Santes read this verse, and the greatest number of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors vnderstand this place to be meant of repenting and conuerting to God: out of which place, this doctrin of the Pelagians hath beene wonted to bee drawen: that it lieth not in our power and strength to conuert: but we must desire it at Gods handes with earnest
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:176914:142"/> and feruent groanes: as Dauid in his 51. Psalme beseecheth the Lord <hi>to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in him a pure and cleane heart.</hi> Our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Interpretors, as Trimelius, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius read it thus, <hi>Restore vs O Lorde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into our former estate, that wee may returne:</hi> as in the 80. Psalme it is said, <hi>Restablish vs O Lord God:</hi> as if he should haue saide, <hi>Chaunge our captiuitie, O Lorde, into freedome, and bring vs againe into the lande of promise.</hi> The like words also we finde in the 126. Psalme, ver. 4. where it is said <hi>Cause vs O Lord, to return out of captiuitie.</hi> And thus much as touching the argumēt of this 5. Chap.</p>

For, we haue long time sithence, alas, seene the East in the West: and thy cleare bright shining sunne; couered with the countries of the Leuant.
